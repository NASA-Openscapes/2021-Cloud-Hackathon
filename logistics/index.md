## For Hackathon Participants

Before the hackathon, please complete the [prerequisites](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/logistics/prerequisites.html#prerequisites) and be prepared for the [daily setup](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/logistics/prerequisites.html#daily-setup) and be familiar with the ways of [getting help](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/logistics/prerequisites.html#getting-help).

## For Hackathon Helpers - A Mentor’s Guide

*Mentor = trainer = helper = any DAAC or Openscapes staff*

### Slack 

**Channels in Openscapes workspace**

Update your Slack name temporarily to include “helper”, e.g. Catalina Oaida (Helper)

* **Mentors’/Helper channel** - **_#nasa-daac-mentors1_** 
    * Our back channel to coordinate amongst ourselves
* **General channel** - **_#2021-nasacloudhack-general_**
    * Announcements, general questions and communications
* **Pitchfest channel -** **_#2021-nasacloudhack-projects_**
    * Participants discuss project ideas
    * Use slack direct message (DM) for team/project work
* **Help channel** - **_#2021-nasacloudhack-help_**
    * Troubleshooting, share screenshots, etc
    * When you see a question you will reply to, please add the “eyes” emoji below so other helpers know that you are looking into it. Then please reply in-thread in Slack to help. Can tag additional helpers if you need further support.

### Github 

Hackathon repo: **<https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Hackathon>**; any updates to the main branch will be updated in this book (via GitHub Action).

* [tutorials](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tree/main/tutorials) folder
* [tutorials-templates](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tree/main/tutorials-templates) folder for live coding - same as tutorials but the code is removed and only markdown remains
* Participants will create their own repos, we can link to their projects in the cloud hackathon repo to capture the hackathon projects artifacts
* Working with the CH repo
    * Participants are instructed to fork the CH repo to their own github, then clone the CH repo. This way they can push any updates or changes to the CH repo within their own version of the repo without impacting the original CH repo
    * This should be covered in Tutorial 0. 
* What happens to my work on 2i2c after the 3 months?
    * Code: push to your own Github repo
    * Data and analysis outputs - working on S3 solution
* From Clinic chapter: “This section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your [2i2c instance](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/clinic/openscapes.2i2c.cloud) and configure git to use your [github.com](https://github.com/) account for managing your repositories hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/).” We are also looking into using Git Extension. 


### Zoom teleconference

* **Host**: Erin and Julie
* **Break-out rooms**
    * We will set up Breakout rooms ahead of time, and have helpers ready to meet with participants. If there are many people in breakout rooms/lots of same issues, we'll pause the tutorial and address things together
    * If a participant is stuck and needs 1:1 help, ping one of the Zoom hosts in the mentor/general channel to place you in a breakout room with participant X
* **Chat** - Encourage participants to use the Slack _general_ or _help_ channel for questions, not the Zoom chat
    * Erin will mention this in the Welcome (logistics) session beginning of Day 1

### Tutorials workflow

* Welcome mentor share link to CH Book during Welcome each day
* Welcome mentor to instruct participant to spin up 2i2c JupyterHub if they haven’t done so that morning already
* Tutorial presenters can also role-model having the CH Book open as a tab when they teach if they want to refer to it. 
* Tutorial presenter will be using [template](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tree/main/tutorials-templates) notebooks based on each tutorial 
* Tutorial presenter will live code, and participants will follow along in their instance 
* Tutorial presenter screen zoom level should be 130%


### Helpers support during “live coding” Tutorials Demos



* Tutorial mentor live codes, participants follow along
* All other helpers monitor Slack _help (_and_ general)_ channel for questions, people being stuck
    * When you see a question you will reply to, please add the “eyes” emoji below so other helpers know that you are looking into it. Then please reply in-thread in Slack to help. Can tag additional helpers if you need further support.
    * If needed, ask host to place you and participant in breakout room temporarily for easier help/support
* Reminder: Update your Slack name temporarily to include “helper”, e.g. “Catalina Oaida (Helper)”


### Helper support during Team Hack Time

* **Zoom host** - Place participants in breakout rooms based on their team 
    * Can collaborate in zoom breakout rooms and in their slack team DM (direct messaging) 
* **Participants** should post any team project questions in the _help_ slack channel; screenshot are helpful
    * Participants can create a DM thread with their teammates for team work discussions
* **Mentors** monitor the _help_ slack channel for questions
    * When you see a question you will reply to, please add the “eyes” emoji below so other helpers know that you are looking into it. Then please reply in-thread in Slack to help. Can tag additional helpers if you need further support.
    * and/or ask host to be added to the team zoom breakout room
* **Mentors** use the _mentor_ slack channel if you need additional help from a colleague
    * They can then also be added to zoom breakout room, as needed
* Beyond the scheduled time for Team Hack Time, the zoom meeting will close out, but participants are welcome to continue to discuss via their DM in slack 
    * No on-call mentor support beyond the scheduled team hack time session
    * Additional help from mentors available 8-9am Tue-Fri during optional office hours
