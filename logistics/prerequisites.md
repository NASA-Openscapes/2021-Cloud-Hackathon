    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Earthdata Login account** 
    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>

    - Consider your computer set-up in advance, including an external monitor if possible.
