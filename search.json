    "text": "The Cloud Hackathon: Transitioning Earthdata Workflows to the Cloud is a virtual 5-day (4 hours per day) collaborative open science learning experience aimed at exploring, creating, and promoting effective cloud-based science and applications workflows using NASA Earthdata Cloud data, tools, and services (among others), in support of Earth science data processing and analysis in the era of big data. Its goals are to:\n\nIntroduce Earth science data users to NASA Earthdata cloud-based data products, tools and services in order to increase awareness and support transition to cloud-based science and applications workflows.\nEnable science and applications workflows in the cloud that leverage NASA Earth Observations and capabilities (services) from within the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, thus increasing NASA Earthdata data utility and meaningfulness for science and applications use cases.\nFoster community engagement utilizing Earthdata cloud tools and services in support of open science and open data.\n\nOutcome: Participants prototype their science and applications workflows (via hackathon projects) that leverage Earthdata Cloud data and services (focusing on, but not limited to, oceanography, cryosphere, hydrology and land data), which supports them in their transition to cloud-based or hybrid workflows for data processing and analysis.\nThis is an opportunity for researchers that might not yet have had the opportunity to work in the Cloud to explore, learn and prototype workflows with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud, but more intermediate or advanced cloud users interested in further exploring cloud workflows with Earthdata Cloud data and service are also welcome."

    "text": "Information for applicants\nThe Cloud Hackathon will be a virtual event held November 15-19, 2021, where participants will explore the intersection of Earth science data, cloud computing, and big data analysis through demonstration tutorials and hands-on “hacking” projects. To best benefit from the event, we recommend some familiarity or experience with:\n\nNASA Earthdata data (focusing on oceanography, cryosphere, hydrology, cryosphere and land data, including interdisciplinary applications); and\nProgramming skills using Python. We plan to accept participants with diverse skill levels and backgrounds in programming. However, to best benefit from and contribute to the program, participants are expected to have some experience with Python programming.\n\nNo cloud computing experience is required, but we encourage both beginner and more experienced participants with AWS cloud to apply.\nIf selected, participants will have the option to attend a Carpentries-style github, python, shell scripting clinic ahead of the Cloud Hachathon.\n\n\nApplication Form\nIn the application form, we encourage you to think about and provide a science use case that you would like to prototype in the cloud. At the beginning of the hackathon, participants will be able to pitch their use case to support the formation of “hack” projects - by which we mean collaboratively experiment working in with NASA Earthdata data and capabilities in the Cloud. During the hackathon, participants will get into teams of their choosing, around a common use case to “hack” in the cloud. The use cases provided in the application form will also help the organizers best prepare materials tailored to those use cases.\nThe application period has now closed. Thank you for your interest."

    "text": "During the Cloud Hackathon, the selected participants will have access to cloud environments in AWS through a JupyterHub interface, provided through 2i2c.\nParticipants will be guided on how to log into the cloud environment, import needed data recipes and resources, and will have the opportunity to explore and develop science and applications workflows in a cloud environment (hosted in AWS) using example tutorials as building blocks.\nThe Cloud Hackathon is an open science event: all tutorials and examples are developed openly and will be publicly available during and following hackathon. Participants will strengthen their practice of open science, using open source code and “hacking” their projects openly to enable further discovery and contributions by the broader open community following the hackathon.\nThroughout the hackathon, participants will learn about NASA’s Earthdata move to the cloud and Earthdata APIs for data discovery, access, and transformations to enable faster, more efficient time to science.\n\nIn the two to three weeks leading up to the hackathon, participants are encouraged to review background resources that will facilitate a more effective hackathon experience. These resources will be shared here leading up to the Hackathon dates, and will be accessible to all data users, whether they attend the hackathon or not.\nThe following datasets are currently available from the NASA Earthdata Cloud. Participants can choose to prototype a cloud-based science workflow using a combination of these datasets, as well as other non-Earthdata Cloud data. If your preferred dataset is not yet available in the Earthdata Cloud, consider using a current cloud-based dataset as proxy to explore prototyping.\n\nhttps://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?ff=Available%20from%20AWS%20Cloud\n\nExample use cases to explore in the cloud (note these are for inspiration only, you are not limited to these workflows):\n\nUse the advanced wildcard search capabilities in Earthdata Search Client/Common Metadata Repository (CMR) to precisely search/select all cloud-archived Sentinel-6A granules\n\nfrom a specific cycle (i.e. a sequence orbits that together provide global spatial coverage), and/or\nfrom a specific pass(es) over multiple cycles (i.e. selected orbits over a series of cycles that together provide a time series coverage).\nThen, prepare the data for gridding or for local analysis at space/time scales which are appropriate for the target analysis (and limited by default given the length of S6A data record…)\n\nTime series analysis across multi-mission measurements spanning data housed both within and outside of NASA Earthdata Cloud, to develop a workflow that can accommodate different data locations, as data continue to migrate to the Cloud:\n\nProgrammatically search for a data variable (e.g. altimetry measurements) at a single point or area of interest across multiple datasets and identify whether the data are available in the Cloud\nAcquire the data based on archived location and combine in order to produce a homogenous time series\n\nExplore/leverage cloud-optimized formats (COFs) such as Zarr to compute global or regional climatology and anomalies for a large-volume dataset (e.g. 1-km MUR SST) without having to download data (in-cloud analysis).\nSubset Level 2 swath dataset of interest spatially and for specific variable and do some exploratory analysis and visualization from within the cloud.\nUse NASA’s CMR-STAC API to search and discover Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) cloud assets based on cloud data products, area of interest, and date range query parameters.\nHarmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) for land monitoring: access, explore, and visualize time series surface reflectance data in the cloud.\n\nThis event is motivated by the dawn of the era of Big Data. NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is in the process of moving EOSDIS data to the cloud, driven by a rapid rate of data ingest into the EOSDIS archive. NASA remote sensing data from both upcoming (e.g. SWOT) and existing (e.g. Terra, Aqua, ICESat-2) missions will be available in the Earthdata Cloud platform in the coming years. The paradigm shift from on-premise (local) to cloud-based data distribution, and that from “download and analyze” to “analysis in place” present opportunities and challenges. Guiding users through this transition is of the utmost importance."

    "text": "We will access monthly ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from ECCO V4r4 (10.5067/ECG5M-OBP44), which are provided as a monthly time series on a 0.5-degree latitude/longitude grid.\nThe data are archived in netCDF format. However, this notebook demonstration will request conversion to Zarr format for files covering the period between 2010 and 2018. Upon receiving our request, Harmony’s backend will convert the files and stage them in S3 for native access in AWS (us-west-2 region, specifically). We will access the new Zarr datasets as an aggregated dataset using xarray, and leverage the S3 native protocols for direct access to the data in an efficient manner.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nAWS\nThis notebook should be running in an EC2 instance in AWS region us-west-2, as previously mentioned. We recommend using an EC2 with at least 8GB of memory available.\nThe notebook was developed and tested using a t2.large instance (2 cpus; 8GB memory).\n\n\nPython 3\nMost of these imports are from the Python standard library.

Support for selection by the dataset ShortName will be added in a future release.\n\nCommon Metadata Repository (CMR)\nFor now, we will need to get the concept-id that corresponds to our dataset by accessing its metadata from the CMR.

No other users will be able to see or access your data files. You can easily upload files to your virtual drive space and save files from the hub back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive.\nHere we’ll show you how to pull (copy) some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space using git. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of each tutorial we’ll ask you to “fork” (create your own copy of in your GitHub account) and “clone” (make a copy of in a computing environment, such as your local computer or Openscapes instance) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your Openscapes drive space.\n\n\n\nterminal-button\n\n\nThis will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface:\n\n\n\nterminal-tab\n\n\nNow you can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system.\nYou may also upload files from your local system using the upload button (up-pointing arrow) on the top left of the JupyterHub navigation panel.

The getting started on a tutorial workflow briefly reviews much of the information in this preliminary exercise along with steps for making and saving notes or other changes as you work through the tutorial and keeping it updated with the original, master copy. The basic git workflow for a project serves as a reminder of the git workflow for working on a group project while minimizing code conflicts that could result from multiple people making changes to the same files simultaneously."

    "section": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)",
    "text": "What is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions (think of it as a directory with files that are being tracked for changes, using git for taking snapshots of versions as you are developing).\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your 2i2c JupyterHub instance (referred to as 2i2c JupyterHub in these instruction). We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps with substeps, includes instruction for addressing github’s new approach for token authentication.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a github account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Fork a repository\nA fork is a copy of a repository from another github account (for example NASA-Openscapes account) to your github account (for example, my account virdi) that then you have permission to edit. To help you finish this setup correctly, we have created a demo repository on Openscapes github account named check_github_setup. You can fork this repository into your github account following these steps:\n\nLog in to your github.com account\nGo to the demo repository at NASA-Openscapes github\n\n\n\nDemo repository on NASA-Openscapes github\n\n\nClick on the fork icon in the top right corner, as shown in the image below and click your user name if prompted to do so\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Clone the repository that you just forked\nNow you have a fork of the demo repository in your github account that we can clone it in your 2i2c instance. In the code below, commands beginning with git is a git command for version control and synching; commands that don’t start with git are bash/linux/command line commands.\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub and open a terminal\nFile >> New >> Terminal\nMake sure you are in your home directory by usingpwd command and verifying the output as below\n/home/jovyan\n\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nNote: This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember git is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by git, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you push your repository to github.com (git push is discussed in a later step).\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File >> New >> Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

So you control if/when you pull in changes. a clone on the other hand, will be linked to the original repository- so if you do “pull” you’ll get the changes from the parent repository as well.\nIf you plan on contributing to a project, a fork is usually the best way to do that, if you plan on simply consuming the project (e.g. run a tutorial) then cloning is fine. A fork can always be appropriate.\nOr, if you plan on updating and making changes that you’d want to preserve, a fork allows you to do that in your own repository, whereas cloning would need you to have permissions to write (push) to the repository."

People often use project time to dig deeper into concepts introduced in tutorials, to explore problems within their own research, or to advance community data sharing and software building efforts.\nThe Cloud Hackathon team is here to help you get clear on project ideas and decide on what is possible within 5 days. Feel free to reach out to any of us between now and the Cloud Hackathon in the 2021-nasacloudhack-help channel, or @ us – we all have “helper” appended to the front of our names. !\n\nAt the end of Day 1 of the Cloud Hackathon we will have a Pitchfest where proposer(s) can pitch their idea, and mention whether they are still looking for teammates or if they have already formed a team using the Slack _#2021-nasacloudhack-projects _channel. At this time we will finalize the project teams for the week.\nTeam hacktime will begin on Day 2.\nEach team is encouraged to identify a project lead, likely the person who pitched the idea, who has knowledge of the datasets and the specific problem to be explored. But roles can be assigned as the group decides to best fit skills and needs.\nThroughout the hackathon we will have optional morning office hours 8-9am PT for additional support or team check-in time.\nOn the final day of the Cloud Hackathon, each team will present their work in a series of lightning talks."

    "text": "In the previous exercises we searched for and discovered cloud data assets that met certain search criteria (i.e., intersects with our region of interest and for a specified date range). The end goal was to find and save web links to the data assets we want to use in our workflow. The links we found allow us to download data via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). However, NASA allows for direct in-region S3 bucket access for the same assets. In addition to saving the HTTPS links, we also created and saved the S3 links for those same cloud assets and we will use them here. In this exercise we will demonstrate how to perform direct in-region S3 bucket access for Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) cloud data assets.\n\nDirect S3 Access\nNASA Earthdata Cloud provides two pathways for accessing data from the cloud. The first is via HTTPS. The other is through direct S3 bucket access. Below are some benefits and considerations when choosing to use direct S3 bucket access for NASA cloud assets.\n\nBenefits\n\nRetrieving data can be much quicker\nNo need to download data! Work with data in a more efficient manner, “next to it, in the cloud”\n\nIncreased capacity to do parallel processing, due to working in the cloud\n\nYou are working completely within the AWS cloud ecosystem and thus have access to the might of all AWS offerings (e.g., infrastructure, S3 API, services, etc.)\n\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nIf your workflow is in the cloud, choose S3 over HTTPS\n\nAccess only works within AWS us-west-2 region\n\nNeed an AWS S3 “token” to access S3 Bucket\n\nToken expires after 1 hour (currently)\n\nToken only works at the DAAC that generates it, e.g.,\n\nPO.DAAC token generator: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials\n\nLP DAAC token generator: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials\n\n\nDirect S3 access on its own does not solve ‘cloud’ problems, but it is one key technology in solving big data problems\n\nStill have to load things in to memory, parallelize the computation, if working with really large data volumes. There are a lot of tools that allow you to do that, but are not discussed in this tutorial"

For more information regarding the temporary credentials visit https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME. A netrc file is required to aquire these credentials. Use the NASA Earthdata Authentication to create a netrc file in your home directory.\n#\n#\n#\n\nInsert the credentials into our boto3 session and configure our rasterio environment for data access\nCreate a boto3 Session object using your temporary credentials. This Session is used to pass credentials and configuration to AWS so we can interact wit S3 objects from applicable buckets.\n#\nFor this exercise, we are going to open up a context manager for the notebook using the rasterio.env module to store the required GDAL and AWS configurations we need to access the data in Earthdata Cloud. While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access Earthdata Cloud data assets. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files.

HLS cloud data assets are stored as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs, a format that has been the benifactor of data discovery and access advancements within the Python ecosystem. Knowing what the data storage format is (e.g., COG, netcdf4, or zarr store) and/or what data access protocol you’re using is critical in determining what Python data access method you will use. For COG data, rioxarray package is often prefered due to is ability to bring the geospatial data format into an xarray object. For netcdf4 files, the standard xarray package incombination with s3fs allow users to perform in-region direct access reads into an xarray object. Finally, if you are using OPeNDAP to connect to data, specialized packages like pydap have been integrated into xarray for streamline access directly to an xarray object."

These data are often provided in GeoTIFF, NetCDF or HDF format with rich and useful metadata that we want to retain, or even use in our analysis. Common analyses include calculating means, standard deviations and anomalies over time or one or more spatial dimensions (e.g. zonal means). Model output often includes multiple variables that you want to apply similar analyses to.\n\n\n\nA schematic of multi-dimensional data\n\n\nThe schematic above shows a typical data structure for multi-dimensional data. There are two data cubes, one for temperature and one for precipitation. Common coordinate variables, in this case latitude, longitude and time are associated with each variable. Each variable, including coordinate variables, will have a set of attributes: name, units, missing value, etc. The file containing the data may also have attributes: source of the data, model name coordinate reference system if the data are projected. Writing code using low-level packages such as netcdf4 and numpy to read the data, then perform analysis, and write the results to file is time consuming and prone to errors."

It has dimensions, lat, lon, and time. It also has coordinate variables with the same names as these dimensions. These coordinate variables are 1-dimensional. This is a NetCDF convention. The Dataset contains one data variable, air. This has dimensions (time, lat, lon).\nClicking on the document icon reveals attributes for each variable.

    "text": "Zarr is an open source library for storing N-dimensional array data. It supports multidimensional arrays with attributes and dimensions similar to NetCDF4, and it can be read by XArray. Zarr is often used for data held in cloud object storage (like Amazon S3), because it is better optimized for these situations than NetCDF4.\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library allows NASA EOSDIS NetCDF4 files to be read more efficiently by transferring only file metadata and data needed for computation in a small number of requests, rather than moving the whole file or making many small requests. It works by making the files directly readable by the Zarr Python library and XArray across a network. To use it, files must have a corresponding metadata file ending in .dmrpp, which increasingly true for cloud-accessible EOSDIS data. https://github.com/nasa/zarr-eosdis-store\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library provides several benefits over downloading EOSDIS data files and accessing them using XArray, NetCDF4, or HDF5 Python libraries:\n\nIt only downloads the chunks of data you actually read, so if you don’t read all variables or the full spatiotemporal extent of a file, you usually won’t spend time downloading those portions of the file\nIt parallelizes and optimizes downloads for the portions of files you do read, so download speeds can be faster in general\nIt automatically interoperates with Earthdata Login if you have a .netrc file set up\nIt is aware of some EOSDIS cloud implementation quirks and provides caching that can save time for repeated requests to individual files\n\nIt can also be faster than using XArray pointing NetCDF4 files with s3:// URLs, depending on the file’s internal structure, and is often more convenient.\nConsider using this library when: 1. The portion of the data file you need to use is much smaller than the full file, e.g. in cases of spatial subsets or reading a single variable from a file containing several 1. s3:// URLs are not readily available 1. Code need to run outside of the AWS cloud or us-west-2 region or in a hybrid cloud / non-cloud manner 1. s3:// access using XArray seems slower than you would expect (possibly due to unoptimized internal file structure) 1. No readily-available, public, cloud-optimized version of the data exists already. The example we show is also available as an AWS Public Dataset: https://registry.opendata.aws/mur/ 1.

We need not worry about the EosdisStore anymore.\nView the file’s variable structure\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\n\n\nAggregate and analyze 30 files\nSet up a function to open all of our URLs as XArrays in parallel\n#\nCombine the individual file-based datasets into a single xarray dataset with a time axis\n#\nLook at the Analysed SST variable metadata\n#\nCreate a dataset / variable that is only our area of interest and view its metadata\n#\nXArray reads data lazily, i.e. only when our code actually needs it. Up to this point, we haven’t read any data values, only metadata. The next line will force XArray to read the portions of the source files containing our area of interest. Behind the scenes, the eosdis-zarr-store library is ensuring data is fetched as efficiently as possible.\nNote: This line isn’t strictly necessary, since XArray will automatically read the data we need the first time our code tries to use it, but calling this will make sure that we can read the data multiple times later on without re-fetching anything from the source files.\nThis line will take several seconds to complete, but since it is retrieving only about 50 MB of data from 22 GB of source files, several seconds constitutes a significant time, bandwidth, and disk space savings.\n#\nNow we can start looking at aggregations across the time dimension. In this case, plot the standard deviation of the temperature at each point to get a visual sense of how much temperatures fluctuate over the course of the month.\n#\n\nInteractive animation of a month of data\nThis section isn’t as important to fully understand. It shows us a way to get an interactive animation to see what we have retrieved so far\nDefine an animation function to plot the ith time step. We need to make sure each plot is using the same color scale, set by vmin and vmax so the animation is consistent\n#\nRender each time slice once and show it as an HTML animation with interactive controls\n#\n\n\n\nSupplemental: What’s happening here?\nFor EOSDIS data in the cloud, we have begun producing a metadata sidecar file in a format called DMR++ that extracts all of the information about arrays, variables, and dimensions from data files, as well as the byte offsets in the NetCDF4 file where data can be found. This information is sufficient to let the Zarr library read data from our NetCDF4 files, but it’s in the wrong format. zarr-eosdis-store knows how to fetch the sidecar file and transform it into something the Zarr library understands. Passing it when reading Zarr using XArray or the Zarr library lets these libraries interact with EOSDIS data exactly as if they were Zarr stores in a way that’s more optimal for reading data in the cloud. Beyond this, the zarr-eosdis-store library makes some optimizations in the way it reads data to help make up for situations where the NetCDF4 file is not internally arranged well for cloud-based access patterns."

The COGs can be used like any other geoTIFF file, but have some added features that make them more efficient within the cloud data access paradigm. These features include: overviews and internal tiling. Below we will demonstrate how to leverage these features.\n\nBut first, what is STAC?\nSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification that provides a common language for interpreting geospatial information in order to standardize indexing and discovering data.\nThe STAC specification is made up of a collection of related, yet independent specifications that when used together provide search and discovery capabilities for remote assets.\n\nFour STAC Specifications\nSTAC Catalog (aka DAAC Archive)\nSTAC Collection (aka Data Product)\nSTAC Item (aka Granule)\nSTAC API\nIn the following sections, we will explore each of STAC element using NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR) STAC application programming interface (API), or CMR-STAC API for short.\n\n\n\nCMR-STAC API\nThe CMR-STAC API is NASA’s implementation of the STAC API specification for all NASA data holdings within EOSDIS. The current implementation does not allow for querries accross the entire NASA catalog. Users must execute searches within provider catalogs (e.g., LPCLOUD) to find the STAC Items they are searching for. All the providers can be found at the CMR-STAC endpoint here: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/.\nIn this exercise, we will query the LPCLOUD provider to identify STAC Items from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) collection that fall within our region of interest (ROI) and within our specified time range."

    "text": "While the CMR-STAC API is a powerful search and discovery utility, it is still maturing and currently does not have the full gamut of filtering capabilities that the STAC API specification allows for. Hence, additional filtering is required if we want to filter by a property, for example cloud cover. Below we will loop through and filter the item_collection by a specified cloud cover as well as extract the band we’d need to do an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) calculation for a future analysis.\nWe’ll make a cloudcover variable where we will set the maximum allowable cloud cover and extract the band links for those Items that match or are less than the max cloud cover.\n#\nWe will also specify the STAC Assets (i.e., bands/layers) of interest for both the S30 and L30 collections (also in our collections variable above).\nIn this hypothetical workflow, we’ll extract the bands needed to calculate an enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Thus, the band needed include red, near infrared (NIR), and blue. We’ll also extract a quality band (i.e., Fmask) that we’d eventually use to perform per-pixel quality filtering.\nNotice that the band ids are in some case not one-to-one between the S30 and the L30 product. This is evident in the NIR band for each product where S30’s NIR band id is B8A and L30’s is B05. Note, the S30 product has an additional NIR band with a band id of B08, but the spectral ranges between B8A and B05 are more closely aligned. Visit the HLS Overview page to learn more about HLS spectral bands.\n#\nAnd now to loop through and filter the item_collection by cloud cover and bands:\n#\nThe filtering done in the previous steps produces a list of links to STAC Assets. Let’s print out the first ten links.\n#\nNOTE that HLS data is mapped to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and is tiled using the Sentinel-2 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) UTM grid. Notice that in the list of links we have multiple tiles, i.e. T14TKL & T13TGF, that intersect with our region of interest. In this case, these two tiles represent neighboring UTM zones. The tiles can be discern from the file name, which is the last element in a link (far right) following the last forward slash (/) - e.g., HLS.L30.T14TKL.2021133T172406.v1.5.B04.tif.

Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible. What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search. This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search. You could make typos or other mistakes.

We will use:\n- requests This package does most of the work for us accessing the CMR API using HTTP methods. - pprint to pretty print the results of the search.\nA more in depth tutorial on requests is here\n#\nThen we need to authenticate with EarthData Login. Since we’ve already set this up in the previous lesson, here you need to enter your username before executing the cell.\nTo conduct a search using the CMR API, requests needs the url for the root CMR search endpoint. We’ll build this url as a python variable.\n#\nCMR allows search by collections, which are datasets, and granules, which are files that contain data. Many of the same search parameters can be used for colections and granules but the type of results returned differ. Search parameters can be found in the API Documentation.\nWhether we search collections or granules is distinguished by adding \"collections\" or \"granules\" to the url for the root CMR endpoint.\nWe are going to search collections first, so we add collections to the url. I’m using a python format string here.\n#\nIn this first example, I want to retrieve a list of collections that are hosted in the cloud. Each collection has a cloud_hosted parameter that is either True if that collection is in the cloud and False if it is not. The migration of NASA data to the cloud is a work in progress. Not all collections tagged as cloud_hosted have granules. To search for only cloud_hosted datasets with granules, I also set has_granules to True.\nI also want to get the content in json (pronounced “jason”) format, so I pass a dictionary to the header keyword argument to say that I want results returned as json.\nThe .get() method is used to send this information to the CMR API. get() calls the HTTP method GET.\n#\nrequests returns a Response object.\nOften, we want to check that our request was successful. In a notebook or someother interactive environment, we can just type the name of the variable we have saved our requests Response to, in this case the response variable.\n#\nA cleaner and more understandable method is to check the status_code attribute. Both methods return a HTTP status code. You’ve probably seen a 404 error when you have tried to access a website that doesn’t exist.\n#\nTry changing CMR_OPS to https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/searches and run requests.get again. Don’t forget to rerun the cell that assigns the url variable\nThe response from requests.get returns the results of the search and metadata about those results in the headers.\nMore information about the response object can be found by typing help(response).\nheaders contains useful information in a case-insensitive dictionary. This information is printed below. TODO: maybe some context for where the 2 elements k, v, come from?\n#\nWe can see that the content returned is in json format in the UTF-8 character set. We can also see from CMR-Hits that 919 collections were found.\nEach item in the dictionary can be accessed in the normal way you access a python dictionary but because it is case-insensitive, both\n#\nand\n#\nwork.\nThis is a large number of data sets. I’m going to restrict the search to cloud-hosted datasets from ASF (Alaska SAR Facility) because I’m interested in SAR images of sea ice. To do this, I set the provider parameter to ASF.\nYou can modify the code below to explore all of the cloud-hosted datasets or cloud-hosted datasets from other providers.

However, response.content returns information in bytes.\n#\nIt is more convenient to work with json formatted data. I’m using pretty print pprint to print the data in an easy to read way.\nStep through response.json(), then to response.json()['feed']['entry'][0]. A reminder that python starts indexing at 0, not 1!\n#\nThe first response is not the result I am looking for TODO: because xyz…but it does show a few variables that we can use to further refine the search.

This is because CMR restricts the number of results returned by a query. The default is 10 but it can be set to a maximum of 2000. Knowing that there were 49 ‘hits’, I’ll set page_size to 49.

    "text": "First, what do we mean by a “service”?\nIn the context of NASA Earthdata, we are usually referring to a service as any data transformation or customization process that packages or delivers data in a way that makes it easier to work with compared to how the data are natively archived at NASA EOSDIS. Basic customization options may include: * Subsetting (cropping) the data by: * Variable * Spatial boundary, * Temporal range * Reformatting * For example: From NetCDF-4 to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF * Reprojection and/or Resampling * For example: From Sinusoidal to Polar Stereographic * Mosaicking * Aggregating\nA few main types or pathways for services that are commonly supported across the NASA DAACs include: * NASA Global Imagery Browse Service * Web services providing imagery, much of which is updated daily, to broaden accessibility of NASA EOSDIS data to the media and public. * Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) * Tiled Web Map Service (TWMS) * Web Map Service (WMS) * Keyhole Markup Language (KML) * Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) * OPeNDAP * The Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol is a NASA community standard DAP that provides a simple way to access and work with data over the internet. OPeNDAP’s client/server software allows us to subset and reformat data using an internet browser, command line interface, and other applications. * Harmony * In the most basic sense, Harmony is an Application Programming Interface, or API, allowing us to request customization options described above, which are then processed and returned as file outputs. Harmony helps to reduce pre-processing steps so we can spend less time preparing the data, and more time doing science.\nNote: These service offerings are unique to each NASA EOSDIS dataset.\nWhy is this?\nDue to varying levels of service, cloud migration status, and unique characteristics of the datasets themselves, not all service options are provided for all datasets. Therefore it is important to first explore a given dataset’s metadata to discover what service options are provided.\nLet’s utilize the CMR API skills we learned on Day 1 to inspect service metadata:\n#\nWe want to search by collection to inspect the access and service options that exist:\n#\nIn the CMR introduction tutorial, we explored cloud-hosted collections from different DAAC providers, and identified the CMR concept-id for a given data set id (also referred to as a short_name).\nHere we are jumping ahead and already know the concept_id we are interested in, by browsing cloud-hosted datasets from PO.DAAC in Earthdata Search: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/podaac-cloud/search.\nWe are going to focus on MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0: GHRSST Level 2P Global Sea Surface Skin Temperature from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua satellite (GDS2). Let’s first save this as a variable that we can use later on once we request data from Harmony.\n#\nWe will view the top-level metadata for this collection to see what additional service and variable metadata exist.\n#\nPrint the response:\n#\n\n\nWhat do each of these service values mean?\n\nAssociations\n\nCMR is a large web of interconnected metadata “schemas”, including Collections, Granules, Services, Tools, and Variables. In this case, this collection is associated with two unique services, two tools, and several unique variables.\n\nTags\n\nThere are also tags that describe what service options exist at a high-level. In this case, we see that this dataset supports the ability to reformat, subset by space and time, as well as by variable. This is used in web applications like Earthdata Search to surface those customization options more readily.\n\nService Features\n\nIn this case, we see three separate “features” listed here: esi, Harmony, and OPeNDAP.\n\n\nWe will dig into more details on what Harmony offers for this dataset.\nFirst, we need to isolate the services returned for this dataset:\n#\n#\nInspect the first service returned. Now we’re going to search the services endpoint to view that individual service’s metadata, like we did with our dataset above. This time, we’re explicitly setting the format of the response to umm-json in the Accept Header in order to see detailed metadata about the service.\n#\nDetails about the service metadata record include the service options provided by the “backend” processor connected to Harmony, in this case the PODAAC Level 2 Cloud Subsetter:\n#\n\n\nDiscover all datasets that support Harmony services\nInstead of searching for services on a known dataset of interest, we may want to discovery all available datasets that are supported for a given service. We can utilize GraphQL, which is a way for us to efficiently gain information across service and collection metadata so that we can print out all supported Harmony datasets. First, we need to specify a query string. Here we are asking to query all collections with service type “Harmony”, and to provide details on the service options attached to those services:\n#\nThis utilizes a different API endpoint to query CMR metdata using GraphQL. Here we set up another request, passing our query string above:\n#\nA json response is returned that provides all collections with Harmony-supported services. We can then extract just the collectionshortName, conceptID, and the service names supported for each collection:\n#"

    "text": "Just like services, a dataset may also be associated to metadata on their individual data variables, which can be used as input if we wish to subset by one or more variables of interest.\n#\nSeveral variable records are returned. Again, like we did for services, we’ll search the variables endpoint to view an individual variable’s metadata, and we’ll print out the list of variables for our dataset.\n#\n#\n#\nNext, print out a simple list of all associated variable names by looping the same variable response we submitted above, this time for each variable:\n#\n#"

    "text": "Harmony-Py provides a pip installable Python alternative to directly using Harmony’s RESTful API to make it easier to request data and service options, especially when interacting within a Python Jupyter Notebook environment.\nThe next steps are adopted from the introduction tutorial notebook provided in the Harmony-Py library:\n\nCreate Harmony Client object\nFirst, we need to create a Harmony Client, which is what we will interact with to submit and inspect a data request to Harmony, as well as to retrieve results.\nWhen creating the Client, we need to provide Earthdata Login credentials, which are required to access data from NASA EOSDIS. This basic line below assumes that we have a .netrc available.\n#\n\n\nHurricane Ida snapshot\nUsing NASA Worldview, we can first explore SST during a tropical storm event; in this case, we can overlay L2 and L4 SST variables against true color imagery to observe Hurricane Ida in August 2021. Although this is a small sample set, this use case could be expanded to explore how SST responds during the Atlantic hurricane over the next several months. The same data that we are requesting below using Harmony-py can also be requested using NASA Earthdata Search\n\n\n\nHurrican Ida snapshot - Worldview\n\n\n\n\nCreate Harmony Request\nThe following are common request parameters:\n\ncollection: Required parameter. This is the NASA EOSDIS collection, or data product. There are two options for inputting a collection of interest:\n\nProvide a concept ID (e.g. C1940473819-POCLOUD)\nData product short name (e.g. MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0).\n\nspatial: Bounding box spatial constraints on the data. The Harmony Bbox class accepts spatial coordinates as decimal degrees in w, s, e, n order, where longitude = -180, 180 and latitude = -90, 90.\ntemporal: Date/time constraints on the data. The example below demonstrates temporal start and end ranges using the python datetime library.\n\nAs we identified above, only subsetting options are available for this dataset. If other service options such as reformatting are available for a given dataset, these can also be specified using Harmony-py: See the documentation for details on how to construct these parameters.\n#\n\n\nCheck Request validity\nBefore submitting a Harmony Request, we can test your request to see if it’s valid and how to fix it if not. In particular, request.is_valid will check to ensure that the spatial BBox bounds and temporal ranges are entered correctly.\n#\n\n\nSubmit request\nNow that the request is created, we can now submit it to Harmony using the Harmony Client object. A job id is returned, which is a unique identifier that represents the submitted request.\n#\n\n\nCheck request status\nWe can check on the progress of a processing job with status(). This method blocks while communicating with the server but returns quickly.\n#\nDepending on the size of the request, it may be helpful to wait until the request has completed processing before the remainder of the code is executed. The wait_for_processing() method will block subsequent lines of code while optionally showing a progress bar.\n#\n\n\nView Harmony job response and output URLs\nOnce the data request has finished processing, we can view details on the job that was submitted to Harmony, including the API call to Harmony, and informational messages on the request if available.\nresult_json() calls wait_for_processing() and returns the complete job in JSON format once processing is complete.\n#\n\n\nDirect cloud access\nNote that the remainder of this tutorial will only succeed when running this notebook within the AWS us-west-2 region.\nHarmony data outputs can be accessed within the cloud using the s3 URLs and AWS credentials provided in the Harmony job response.\n\nRetrieve list of output URLs.\nThe result_urls() method calls wait_for_processing() and returns a list of the processed data URLs once processing is complete. You may optionally show the progress bar as shown below.\n#\nWe can see that the first file returned does not include the _subsetted suffix, which indicates that a blank file was returned, as no data values were located within our subsetted region. We’ll select the second URL in the list to bring into xarray below.\n#\n\n\nAWS credential retrieval\nUsing aws_credentials you can retrieve the credentials needed to access the Harmony s3 staging bucket and its contents.\n#\n\n\n\nOpen staged files with s3fs and xarray\nWe use the AWS s3fs package to create a file system that can then be read by xarray:\n#\nNow that we have our s3 file system set, including our declared credentials, we’ll use that to open the url, and read in the file through xarray. This extra step is needed because xarray cannot open the S3 location directly. Instead, the S3 file object is passed to xarray, in order to then open the dataset.\n#\n\n\nPlot the data\nUse the xarray built in plotting function to create a simple plot along the x and y dimensions of the dataset:\n#"

multiple threads.\n\nwith python3:\nimport requests\n\ndef download(source: str, target: str):\n    with requests.get(source, stream=True) as remote, open(target, 'wb') as local:\n        if remote.status_code // 100 == 2: \n            for chunk in remote.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):\n                if chunk:\n                    local.write(chunk)\n\n\nwith wget:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor\nThe source files range from 2.5MB to 3.0MB. These OPeNDAP subsets are ~100KB apiece. (anecdote: it took less than 10 minutes to download subsets for >1700 granules/files when I ran this routine for all cycles going back to 2021-06-22.)\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/du-invocation.html\n\n\nAggregate cycle\nSort the list of local subsets to ensure they concatenate in proper order. Call open_mfdataset on the list to open all the subsets in memory as one dataset in xarray.\nhttps://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_mfdataset.html\nMake a dictionary to rename variables so that the data_01_ prefix is removed from each one.\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip\n\n\nPlot ssha variable\nhttps://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.rename.html\n\n\n\nBorrow 0.5-Degree Grid and Mask from ECCO V4r4\n\nAcknowledgement: This approach using pyresample was shared to me by Ian Fenty, ECCO Lead.\n\nhttps://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C2013583732-POCLOUD\nECCO V4r4 products are distributed in two spatial formats. One set of collections provides the ocean state estimates on the native model grid (LLC0090) and the other provides them after interpolating to a regular grid defined in geographic coordinates with horizontal cell size of 0.5-degrees.\nIt’s distributed as its own dataset/collection containing just one file. We can simply download it from the HTTPS download endpoint – the file size is inconsequential. The next cell downloads the file into the data folder from the granule’s https endpoint.\nhttps://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_dataset.html\nSelect index 0 on the Z axis/dimension to get the depth layer at ocean surface.\nhttps://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.isel.html\nThe maskC variable contains a boolean mask representing the wet/dry state of the area contained in each cell of the 3d grid defined by Z and latitude and longitude. Here are the variable’s attributes:\nPlot the land/water mask maskC:\nhttps://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.plot.html\nDefine target grid based on the longitudes and latitudes from the ECCO grid geometry dataset. This time define the grid using two 2-dimensional arrays that give positions of all SSHA values in geographic/longitude-latitude coordinates.\nCreate the target swath definition from the 2d arrays of lons and lats from ECCO V4r4 0.5-degree grid.\npyresample.geometry.SwathDefinition\n\n\nGrid ssha or other variable\nGet one timestamp to represent the midpoint of the 10-day cycle.\nAccess the target variable, ssha in this case. Make a nan mask from the ssha variable.\nCreate the source swath definition from the 1d arrays of lons and lats from the S6 level-2 along-track altimetry time series.\npyresample.geometry.SwathDefinition\nResample ssha data using kd-tree gaussian weighting neighbour approach.\npyresample.kd_tree.resample_gauss\nApply the land/water mask in the numpy array created from the ECCO layer in the steps above. Then, convert the masked numpy array to an xarray data array object named gridded. Print its header.\n\n\nExercise\nCalculate area-weighted mean sea level.\n\n\nReferences\nnumpy (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference)\n\nnumpy.ndarray.data\n\nnumpy.where\n\nnumpy.isnan\n\ndatetimes\n\nnumpy.sum\n\nnumpy.nansum\n\nxarray (https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable)\n\nxarray.DataArray\n\nxarray.DataArray.values\n\nxarray.DataArray.mean"

    "text": "This tutorial will combine several workflow steps and components from the previous days, demonstrating the process of using the geolocation of data available outside of the Earthdata Cloud to then access coincident variables of cloud-accessible data. This may be a common use case as NASA Earthdata continues to migrate to the cloud, producing a “hybrid” data archive across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and original on-premise data storage systems. Additionally, you may also want to combine field measurements with remote sensing data available on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThis specific example explores the pairing of the ICESat-2 ATL07 Sea Ice Height data product, currently (as of November 2021) available publicly via direct download at the NSIDC DAAC, along with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the GHRSST MODIS L2 dataset (MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0) available from PO.DAAC on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThe use case we’re looking at today centers over an area north of Greenland for a single day in June, where a melt pond was observed using the NASA OpenAltimetry application. Melt ponds are an important feature of Arctic sea ice dynamics, leading to an decrease in sea ice albedo and other changes in heat balance. Many NASA Earthdata datasets produce variables including sea ice albedo, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and sea ice height, which can be used to better understand these dynamics.\n\nObjectives\n\nPractice skills searching for data in CMR, determining granule coverage across two datasets over an area of interest.\nDownload data from an on-premise storage system to our cloud environment.\nRead in 1-dimensional trajectory data (ICESat-2 ATL07) into xarray and perform attribute conversions.\nSelect and read in sea surface temperature (SST) data (MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0) from the Earthdata Cloud into xarray.\nExtract, resample, and plot coincident SST data based on ICESat-2 geolocation."

How many granules are returned?\n#\n#\nPrint the file names, size, and links:\n#\n\nDownload ATL07 files\nAlthough several services are supported for ICESat-2 data, we are demonstrating direct access through the “on-prem” file system at NSIDC for simplicity.\nSome of these services include: - icepyx - From the icepyx documentation: “icepyx is both a software library and a community composed of ICESat-2 data users, developers, and the scientific community. We are working together to develop a shared library of resources - including existing resources, new code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - that simplify the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and manipulating ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific discovery.” - NSIDC DAAC Data Access and Service API - The API provided by the NSIDC DAAC allows you to access data programmatically using specific temporal and spatial filters. The same subsetting, reformatting, and reprojection services available on select data sets through NASA Earthdata Search can also be applied using this API. - IceFlow - The IceFlow python library simplifies accessing and combining data from several of NASA’s cryospheric altimetry missions, including ICESat/GLAS, Operation IceBridge, and ICESat-2. In particular, IceFlow harmonizes the various file formats and georeferencing parameters across several of the missions’ data sets, allowing you to analyze data across the multi-decadal time series.\nWe’ve found 2 granules. We’ll download the first one and write it to a file with the same name as the producer_granule_id.\nWe need the url for the granule as well. This is href links we printed out above.\n#\nTo retrieve the granule data, we use the requests.get() method, which will utilize the .netrc file on the backend to authenticate the request against Earthdata Login.\n#\nThe response returned by requests has the same structure as all the other responses: a header and contents. The header information has information about the response, including the size of the data we downloaded in bytes.\n#\nThe contents needs to be saved to a file. To keep the directory clean, we will create a downloads directory to store the file. We can use a shell command to do this or use the makedirs method from the os package.\n#\nYou should see a downloads directory in the file browser.\nTo write the data to a file, we use open to open a file. We need to specify that the file is open for writing by using the write-mode w. We also need to specify that we want to write bytes by setting the binary-mode b. This is important because the response contents are bytes. The default mode for open is text-mode. So make sure you use b.\nWe’ll use the with statement context-manager to open the file, write the contents of the response, and then close the file. Once the data in r.content is written sucessfully to the file, or if there is an error, the file is closed by the context-manager.\nWe also need to prepend the downloads path to the filename. We do this using Path from the pathlib package in the standard library.\n#\n#\nATL07-01_20190622055317_12980301_004_01.h5 is an HDF5 file. xarray can open this but you need to tell it which group to read the data from. In this case we read the sea ice segment height data for ground-track 1 left-beam. You can explore the variable hierarchy in Earthdata Search, by selecting the Customize option under Download Data.\nThis code block performs the following operations: - Extracts the height_segment_height variable from the heights group, along with the dimension variables contained in the higher level sea_ice_segments group, - Convert attributes from bytestrings to strings, - Drops the HDF attribute DIMENSION_LIST, - Sets _FillValue to NaN\n#\n#"

    "text": "Our CMR granule search returned 14 files for our time and area of interest. However, not all granules will be suitable for analysis.\nI’ve identified the image with granule id G1956158784-POCLOUD as a good candidate, this is the 9th granule. In this image, our area of interest is close to nadir. This means that the instantaneous field of view over the area of interest cover a smaller area than at the edge of the image.\nWe are looking for the link for direct download access via s3. This is a url but with a prefix s3://. This happens to be the first href link in the metadata.\nFor a single granule we can cut and paste the s3 link. If we have several granules, the s3 links can be extracted with some simple code.\n#\n\nGet S3 credentials\nAs with the previous S3 download tutorials we need credentials to access data from s3: access keys and tokens.\n#\nEssentially, what we are doing in this step is to “mount” the s3 bucket as a file system. This allows us to treat the S3 bucket in a similar way to a local file system.\n#\n\n\nOpen a s3 file\nNow we have the S3FileSystem set up, we can access the granule. xarray cannot open a S3File directly, so we use the open method for the S3FileSystem to open the granule using the endpoint url we extracted from the metadata. We also have to set the mode='rb'. This opens the granule in read-only mode and in byte-mode. Byte-mode is important. By default, open opens a file as text - in this case it would just be a string of characters - and xarray doesn’t know what to do with that.\nWe then pass the S3File object f to xarray.open_dataset. For this dataset, we also have to set decode_cf=False. This switch tells xarray not to use information contained in variable attributes to generate human readable coordinate variables. Normally, this should work for netcdf files but for this particular cloud-hosted dataset, variable attribute data is not in the form expected by xarray. We’ll fix this.\n#\nIf you click on the Show/Hide Attributes icon (the first document-like icon to the right of coordinate variable metadata) you can see that attributes are one-element arrays containing bytestrings.\n#\nTo fix this, we need to extract array elements as scalars, and convert those scalars from bytestrings to strings. We use the decode method to do this. The bytestrings are encoded as utf-8, which is a unicode character format. This is the default encoding for decode but we’ve included it as an argument to be explicit.\nNot all attributes are bytestrings. Some are floats. Take a look at _FillValue, and valid_min and valid_max. To avoid an error, we use the isinstance function to check if the value of an attributes is type bytes - a bytestring. If it is, then we decode it. If not, we just extract the scalar and do nothing else.\nWe also fix the global attributes.\n#\nWith this done, we can use the xarray function decode_cf to convert the attributes.\n#\n#\nLet’s make a quick plot to take a look at the sea_surface_temperature variable.\n#\n\n\nPlot MODIS and ICESat-2 data on a map\n#\n\n\nExtract SST coincident with ICESat-2 track\nThe MODIS SST is swath data, not a regularly-spaced grid of sea surface temperatures. ICESat-2 sea surface heights are irregularly spaced segments along one ground-track traced by the ATLAS instrument on-board ICESat-2. Fortunately, pyresample allows us to resample swath data.\npyresample has many resampling methods. We’re going to use the nearest neighbour resampling method, which is implemented using a k-dimensional tree algorithm or K-d tree. K-d trees are data structures that improve search efficiency for large data sets.\nThe first step is to define the geometry of the ICESat-2 and MODIS data. To do this we use the latitudes and longitudes of the datasets.\n#\n#\nWe then implement the resampling method, passing the two geometries we have defined, the data array we want to resample - in this case sea surface temperature, and a search radius. The resampling method expects a numpy.Array rather than an xarray.DataArray, so we use values to get the data as a numpy.Array.\nWe set the search radius to 1000 m. The MODIS data is nominally 1km spacing.\n#\n#\n#\n\n\nPlot SST and Height along track\nThis is a quick plot of the extracted data. We’re using matplotlib so we can use latitude as the x-value:\n#"

    "text": "In the previous exercises we searched for and discovered cloud data assets that met certain search criteria (i.e., intersects with our region of interest and for a specified date range). The end goal was to find and save web links to the data assets we want to use in our workflow. The links we found allow us to download data via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). However, NASA allows for direct in-region S3 bucket access for the same assets. In addition to saving the HTTPS links, we also created and saved the S3 links for those same cloud assets and we will use them here. In this exercise we will demonstrate how to perform direct in-region S3 bucket access for Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) cloud data assets.\n\nDirect S3 Access\nNASA Earthdata Cloud provides two pathways for accessing data from the cloud. The first is via HTTPS. The other is through direct S3 bucket access. Below are some benefits and considerations when choosing to use direct S3 bucket access for NASA cloud assets.\n\nBenefits\n\nRetrieving data can be much quicker\nNo need to download data! Work with data in a more efficient manner, “next to it, in the cloud”\n\nIncreased capacity to do parallel processing, due to working in the cloud\n\nYou are working completely within the AWS cloud ecosystem and thus have access to the might of all AWS offerings (e.g., infrastructure, S3 API, services, etc.)\n\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nIf your workflow is in the cloud, choose S3 over HTTPS\n\nAccess only works within AWS us-west-2 region\n\nNeed an AWS S3 “token” to access S3 Bucket\n\nToken expires after 1 hour (currently)\n\nToken only works at the DAAC that generates it, e.g.,\n\nPO.DAAC token generator: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials\n\nLP DAAC token generator: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials\n\n\nDirect S3 access on its own does not solve ‘cloud’ problems, but it is one key technology in solving big data problems\n\nStill have to load things in to memory, parallelize the computation, if working with really large data volumes. There are a lot of tools that allow you to do that, but are not discussed in this tutorial"

While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access Earthdata Cloud data assets. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files. GDAL has a lot of environment variables that control it’s behavior. Changing these settings can mean the difference being able to access a file or not. They can also have an impact on the performance.\n\nrio_env = rio.Env(AWSSession(session),\n                  GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN='EMPTY_DIR',\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'),\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'))\nrio_env.__enter__()\n\n<rasterio.env.Env at 0x7f1619fbb0a0>"

    "text": "The above exercise demonstrated how to perform in-region direct S3 bucket access for HLS cloud data assets. HLS cloud data assets are stored as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs, a format that has been the benifactor of data discovery and access advancements within the Python ecosystem. Knowing what the data storage format is (e.g., COG, netcdf4, or zarr store) and/or what data access protocol you’re using is critical in determining what Python data access method you will use. For COG data, rioxarray package is often prefered due to is ability to bring the geospatial data format into an xarray object. For netcdf4 files, the standard xarray package incombination with s3fs allow users to perform in-region direct access reads into an xarray object. Finally, if you are using OPeNDAP to connect to data, specialized packages like pydap have been integrated into xarray for streamline access directly to an xarray object."

    "text": "As Geoscientists, we often work with time series of data with two or more dimensions: a time series of calibrated, orthorectified satellite images; two-dimensional grids of surface air temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis; or three-dimensional (level, x, y) cubes of ocean salinity from an ocean model. These data are often provided in GeoTIFF, NetCDF or HDF format with rich and useful metadata that we want to retain, or even use in our analysis. Common analyses include calculating means, standard deviations and anomalies over time or one or more spatial dimensions (e.g. zonal means). Model output often includes multiple variables that you want to apply similar analyses to.\n\n\n\nA schematic of multi-dimensional data\n\n\nThe schematic above shows a typical data structure for multi-dimensional data. There are two data cubes, one for temperature and one for precipitation. Common coordinate variables, in this case latitude, longitude and time are associated with each variable. Each variable, including coordinate variables, will have a set of attributes: name, units, missing value, etc. The file containing the data may also have attributes: source of the data, model name coordinate reference system if the data are projected. Writing code using low-level packages such as netcdf4 and numpy to read the data, then perform analysis, and write the results to file is time consuming and prone to errors."

    "text": "In this tutorial you will learn how to:\n\nload a netcdf file into xarray\ninterrogate the Dataset and understand the difference between DataArray and Dataset\nsubset a Dataset\ncalculate annual and monthly mean fields\ncalculate a time series of zonal means\nplot these results\n\nAs always, we’ll start by importing xarray. We’ll follow convention by giving the module the shortname xr\nimport xarray as xr\nxr.set_options(keep_attrs=True)\nI’m going to use one of xarray’s tutorial datasets. In this case, air temperature from the NCEP reanalysis. I’ll assign the result of the open_dataset to ds. I may change this to access a dataset directly\nds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset(\"air_temperature\")\nAs we are in an interactive environment, we can just type ds to see what we have.\nds\nFirst thing to notice is that ds is an xarray.Dataset object. It has dimensions, lat, lon, and time. It also has coordinate variables with the same names as these dimensions. These coordinate variables are 1-dimensional. This is a NetCDF convention. The Dataset contains one data variable, air. This has dimensions (time, lat, lon).\nClicking on the document icon reveals attributes for each variable. Clicking on the disk icon reveals a representation of the data.\nEach of the data and coordinate variables can be accessed and examined using the variable name as a key.\nds.air\nds['air']\nThese are xarray.DataArray objects. This is the basic building block for xarray.\nVariables can also be accessed as attributes of ds.\nds.time\nA major difference between accessing a variable as an attribute versus using a key is that the attribute is read-only but the key method can be used to update the variable. For example, if I want to convert the units of air from Kelvin to degrees Celsius.\nds['air'] = ds.air - 273.15\nThis approach can also be used to add new variables\nds['air_kelvin'] = ds.air + 273.15\nIt is helpful to update attributes such as units, this saves time, confusion and mistakes, especially when you save the dataset.\nds['air'].attrs['units'] = 'degC'\nds"

    "section": "Subsetting and Indexing",
    "text": "Subsetting and indexing methods depend on whether you are working with a Dataset or DataArray. A DataArray can be accessed using positional indexing just like a numpy array. To access the temperature field for the first time step, you do the following.\nds['air'][0,:,:]\nNote this returns a DataArray with coordinates but not attributes.\nHowever, the real power is being able to access variables using coordinate variables. I can get the same subset using the following. (It’s also more explicit about what is being selected and robust in case I modify the DataArray and expect the same output.)\nds['air'].sel(time='2013-01-01').time\nds.air.sel(time='2013-01-01')\nI can also do slices. I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado. The bounding box for the state is [-109 E, -102 E, 37 N, 41 N].\nIn the code below, pay attention to both the order of the coordinates and the range of values. The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates. Note lon is 0 to 360 not -180 to 180, and I let python calculate it for me within the slice.\nds.air.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\nWhat if we want temperature for a point, for example Denver, CO (39.72510678889283 N, -104.98785545855408 E). xarray can handle this! If we just want data from the nearest grid point, we can use sel and specify the method as “nearest”.\ndenver_lat, denver_lon = 39.72510678889283, -104.98785545855408\nds.air.sel(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='nearest')\nIf we want to interpolate, we can use interp(). In this case I use linear or bilinear interpolation.\ninterp() can also be used to resample data to a new grid and even reproject data\nds.air.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')\nsel() and interp() can also be used on Dataset objects.\nds.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\nds.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')"

The credentials give users direct access to S3 buckets in NASA Earthdata Cloud. AWS credentials should not be shared, so take precautions when using them in notebooks our scripts. Note, these temporary credentials are valid for only 1 hour. For more information regarding the temporary credentials visit https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME.\ndef get_temp_creds():\n    temp_creds_url = 'https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials'\n    return requests.get(temp_creds_url).json()\ntemp_creds_req = get_temp_creds()\n#temp_creds_req                      # !!!

While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access Earthdata Cloud data assets. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files. GDAL has a lot of environment variables that control it’s behavior. Changing these settings can mean the difference being able to access a file or not. They can also have an impact on the performance.\n\nrio_env = rio.Env(AWSSession(session),\n                  GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN='TRUE',\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'),\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'))\nrio_env.__enter__()\n\n<rasterio.env.Env at 0x7fdb42409c10>\n\n\n\n\n\nRead In and Process STAC Asset Links\nIn the previous section, we used the NASA CMR-STAC API to discover HLS assets the intersect with our search criteria, i.e., ROI, Date range, and collections.

Below we not only read in the VRT file using rioxarray, but we also repurpose the band variable, which is generated automatically, to hold out time information.\n\nRead the RED VRT in as xarray with Dask backing\n\n%%time\n\nchunks=dict(band=1, x=1024, y=1024)\n#chunks=dict(band=1, x=512, y=512)\nred = rioxarray.open_rasterio('./data/red_stack.vrt', chunks=chunks)                    # Read in VRT\nred = red.rename({'band':'time'})                                                       # Rename the 'band' coordinate variable to 'time' \nred['time'] = [datetime.strptime(x.split('.')[-5], '%Y%jT%H%M%S') for x in links_vsi]   # Extract the time information from the input file names and assign them to the time coordinate variable\nred = red.sortby('time')                                                                # Sort by the time coordinate variable\nred\n\nCPU times: user 219 ms, sys: 20.3 ms, total: 239 ms\nWall time: 246 ms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.DataArray

    "text": "Zarr is an open source library for storing N-dimensional array data. It supports multidimensional arrays with attributes and dimensions similar to NetCDF4, and it can be read by XArray. Zarr is often used for data held in cloud object storage (like Amazon S3), because it is better optimized for these situations than NetCDF4.\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library allows NASA EOSDIS NetCDF4 files to be read more efficiently by transferring only file metadata and data needed for computation in a small number of requests, rather than moving the whole file or making many small requests. It works by making the files directly readable by the Zarr Python library and XArray across a network. To use it, files must have a corresponding metadata file ending in .dmrpp, which increasingly true for cloud-accessible EOSDIS data. https://github.com/nasa/zarr-eosdis-store\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library provides several benefits over downloading EOSDIS data files and accessing them using XArray, NetCDF4, or HDF5 Python libraries:\n\nIt only downloads the chunks of data you actually read, so if you don’t read all variables or the full spatiotemporal extent of a file, you usually won’t spend time downloading those portions of the file\nIt parallelizes and optimizes downloads for the portions of files you do read, so download speeds can be faster in general\nIt automatically interoperates with Earthdata Login if you have a .netrc file set up\nIt is aware of some EOSDIS cloud implementation quirks and provides caching that can save time for repeated requests to individual files\n\nIt can also be faster than using XArray pointing NetCDF4 files with s3:// URLs, depending on the file’s internal structure, and is often more convenient.\nConsider using this library when: 1. The portion of the data file you need to use is much smaller than the full file, e.g. in cases of spatial subsets or reading a single variable from a file containing several 1. s3:// URLs are not readily available 1. Code need to run outside of the AWS cloud or us-west-2 region or in a hybrid cloud / non-cloud manner 1. s3:// access using XArray seems slower than you would expect (possibly due to unoptimized internal file structure) 1. No readily-available, public, cloud-optimized version of the data exists already. The example we show is also available as an AWS Public Dataset: https://registry.opendata.aws/mur/ 1. Adding “.dmrpp” to the end of a data URL returns a file\n\nObjectives\n\nBuild on prior knowledge from CMR and Earthdata Login tutorials\nWork through an example of using the EOSDIS Zarr Store to access data using XArray\nLearn about the Zarr format and library for accessing data in the cloud ___"

Up to this point, we haven’t read any data values, only metadata. The next line will force XArray to read the portions of the source files containing our area of interest. Behind the scenes, the eosdis-zarr-store library is ensuring data is fetched as efficiently as possible.\nNote: This line isn’t strictly necessary, since XArray will automatically read the data we need the first time our code tries to use it, but calling this will make sure that we can read the data multiple times later on without re-fetching anything from the source files.\nThis line will take several seconds to complete, but since it is retrieving only about 50 MB of data from 22 GB of source files, several seconds constitutes a significant time, bandwidth, and disk space savings.\nsst.load();\nNow we can start looking at aggregations across the time dimension.

This information is sufficient to let the Zarr library read data from our NetCDF4 files, but it’s in the wrong format. zarr-eosdis-store knows how to fetch the sidecar file and transform it into something the Zarr library understands. Passing it when reading Zarr using XArray or the Zarr library lets these libraries interact with EOSDIS data exactly as if they were Zarr stores in a way that’s more optimal for reading data in the cloud. Beyond this, the zarr-eosdis-store library makes some optimizations in the way it reads data to help make up for situations where the NetCDF4 file is not internally arranged well for cloud-based access patterns."

    "text": "In this example we will access the NASA’s Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) version 2 assets, which are archived in cloud optimized geoTIFF (COG) format in the LP DAAC Cumulus cloud space. The COGs can be used like any other geoTIFF file, but have some added features that make them more efficient within the cloud data access paradigm. These features include: overviews and internal tiling. Below we will demonstrate how to leverage these features.\n\nBut first, what is STAC?\nSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification that provides a common language for interpreting geospatial information in order to standardize indexing and discovering data.\nThe STAC specification is made up of a collection of related, yet independent specifications that when used together provide search and discovery capabilities for remote assets.\n\nFour STAC Specifications\nSTAC Catalog (aka DAAC Archive)\nSTAC Collection (aka Data Product)\nSTAC Item (aka Granule)\nSTAC API\nIn the following sections, we will explore each of STAC element using NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR) STAC application programming interface (API), or CMR-STAC API for short.\n\n\n\nCMR-STAC API\nThe CMR-STAC API is NASA’s implementation of the STAC API specification for all NASA data holdings within EOSDIS. The current implementation does not allow for querries accross the entire NASA catalog. Users must execute searches within provider catalogs (e.g., LPCLOUD) to find the STAC Items they are searching for. All the providers can be found at the CMR-STAC endpoint here: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/.\nIn this exercise, we will query the LPCLOUD provider to identify STAC Items from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) collection that fall within our region of interest (ROI) and within our specified time range."

Let’s take a quick detour to break it down.\n\n\n\nSpecify date range\nNext up is to specify our date range using ISO_8601 date formatting.\n#date_range = \"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z/2021-08-30T23:59:59Z\"    # closed interval\n#date_range = \"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z/..\"                      # open interval - does not currently work with the CMR-STAC API\ndate_range = \"2021-05/2021-08\"\n\n\nSpecify the STAC Collections\nSTAC Collection is synonomous with what we usually consider a NASA data product. Desired STAC Collections are submitted to the search API as a list containing the collection id. We can use the ids that we printed from our products for loop above. Let’s focus on S30 and L30 collections.\n\ncollections = ['HLSL30.v2.0', 'HLSS30.v2.0']\ncollections\n\n['HLSL30.v2.0', 'HLSS30.v2.0']"

    "text": "While the CMR-STAC API is a powerful search and discovery utility, it is still maturing and currently does not have the full gamut of filtering capabilities that the STAC API specification allows for. Hence, additional filtering is required if we want to filter by a property, for example cloud cover. Below we will loop through and filter the item_collection by a specified cloud cover as well as extract the band we’d need to do an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) calculation for a future analysis.\nWe’ll make a cloudcover variable where we will set the maximum allowable cloud cover and extract the band links for those Items that match or are less than the max cloud cover.\ncloudcover = 25\nWe will also specify the STAC Assets (i.e., bands/layers) of interest for both the S30 and L30 collections (also in our collections variable above).\nIn this hypothetical workflow, we’ll extract the bands needed to calculate an enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Thus, the band needed include red, near infrared (NIR), and blue. We’ll also extract a quality band (i.e., Fmask) that we’d eventually use to perform per-pixel quality filtering.\nNotice that the band ids are in some case not one-to-one between the S30 and the L30 product. This is evident in the NIR band for each product where S30’s NIR band id is B8A and L30’s is B05. Note, the S30 product has an additional NIR band with a band id of B08, but the spectral ranges between B8A and B05 are more closely aligned. Visit the HLS Overview page to learn more about HLS spectral bands.\ns30_bands = ['B8A', 'B04', 'B02', 'Fmask']    # S30 bands for EVI calculation and quality filtering -> NIR, RED, BLUE, Quality \nl30_bands = ['B05', 'B04', 'B02', 'Fmask']    # L30 bands for EVI calculation and quality filtering -> NIR, RED, BLUE, Quality \nAnd now to loop through and filter the item_collection by cloud cover and bands:\nevi_band_links = []\n\nfor i in item_collection:\n    if i.properties['eo:cloud_cover'] <= cloudcover:\n        if i.collection_id == 'HLSS30.v2.0':\n            #print(i.properties['eo:cloud_cover'])\n            evi_bands = s30_bands\n        elif i.collection_id == 'HLSL30.v2.0':\n            #print(i.properties['eo:cloud_cover'])\n            evi_bands = l30_bands\n\n        for a in i.assets:\n            if any(b==a for b in evi_bands):\n                evi_band_links.append(i.assets[a].href)\nThe filtering done in the previous steps produces a list of links to STAC Assets.

It is the backend of Earthdata Search, the GUI search interface you are probably familiar with. More information about CMR can be found here.\nUnfortunately, the GUI for Earthdata Search is not accessible from a cloud instance - at least not without some work. Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible. What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search. This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search. You could make typos or other mistakes. A cleaner, reproducible solution is to search CMR programmatically using the CMR API."

The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\nThe CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results."

    "section": "How to search CMR from Python",
    "text": "The first step is to import python packages. We will use:\n- requests This package does most of the work for us accessing the CMR API using HTTP methods. - pprint to pretty print the results of the search.\nA more in depth tutorial on requests is here\nimport requests\nfrom pprint import pprint\nThen we need to authenticate with EarthData Login. Since we’ve already set this up in the previous lesson, here you need to enter your username before executing the cell.\nTo conduct a search using the CMR API, requests needs the url for the root CMR search endpoint. We’ll build this url as a python variable.\nCMR_OPS = 'https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search'\nCMR allows search by collections, which are datasets, and granules, which are files that contain data. Many of the same search parameters can be used for colections and granules but the type of results returned differ. Search parameters can be found in the API Documentation.\nWhether we search collections or granules is distinguished by adding \"collections\" or \"granules\" to the url for the root CMR endpoint.\nWe are going to search collections first, so we add collections to the url. I’m using a python format string here.\nurl = f'{CMR_OPS}/{\"collections\"}'\nIn this first example, I want to retrieve a list of collections that are hosted in the cloud. Each collection has a cloud_hosted parameter that is either True if that collection is in the cloud and False if it is not. The migration of NASA data to the cloud is a work in progress. Not all collections tagged as cloud_hosted have granules. To search for only cloud_hosted datasets with granules, I also set has_granules to True.\nI also want to get the content in json (pronounced “jason”) format, so I pass a dictionary to the header keyword argument to say that I want results returned as json.\nThe .get() method is used to send this information to the CMR API. get() calls the HTTP method GET.\nresponse = requests.get(url,\n                        params={\n                            'cloud_hosted': 'True',\n                            'has_granules': 'True',\n                        },\n                        headers={\n                            'Accept': 'application/json',\n                        }\n                       )\nrequests returns a Response object.\nOften, we want to check that our request was successful. In a notebook or someother interactive environment, we can just type the name of the variable we have saved our requests Response to, in this case the response variable.\n\nresponse\n\n<Response [200]>\n\n\nA cleaner and more understandable method is to check the status_code attribute. Both methods return a HTTP status code. You’ve probably seen a 404 error when you have tried to access a website that doesn’t exist.\n\nresponse.status_code\n\n200\n\n\nTry changing CMR_OPS to https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/searches and run requests.get again. Don’t forget to rerun the cell that assigns the url variable\nThe response from requests.get returns the results of the search and metadata about those results in the headers.\nMore information about the response object can be found by typing help(response).\nheaders contains useful information in a case-insensitive dictionary. This information is printed below. TODO: maybe some context for where the 2 elements k, v, come from?\n\nfor k, v in response.headers.items():\n    print(f'{k}: {v}')\n\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 3820\nConnection: keep-alive\nDate: Tue, 02 Nov 2021 22:07:37 GMT\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nCMR-Request-Id: 510cf611-d65b-4b46-981b-f4719405676a\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000\nCMR-Search-After: [0.0,14000.0,\"SENTINEL-1A_RAW\",\"1\",1214470561,1320]\nCMR-Hits: 917\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: CMR-Hits, CMR-Request-Id, X-Request-Id, CMR-Scroll-Id, CMR-Search-After, CMR-Timed-Out, CMR-Shapefile-Original-Point-Count, CMR-Shapefile-Simplified-Point-Count\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCMR-Took: 435\nX-Request-Id: 510cf611-d65b-4b46-981b-f4719405676a\nVary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nServer: ServerTokens ProductOnly\nX-Cache: Miss from cloudfront\nVia: 1.1 3f7e5e686bf8f19b9c786efbe99c7589.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)\nX-Amz-Cf-Pop: DEN52-C1\nX-Amz-Cf-Id: BXEUlb5ygB9nj9ygUbSZvIc3BE4k0d1Mn1qDd66IkkuX1rC_Z-mN6Q==\n\n\nWe can see that the content returned is in json format in the UTF-8 character set.

yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ.\nBounding box coordinates are lower left longitude, lower left latitude, upper right longitude, upper right latitude.\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, \n

    "text": "In the previous exercises we searched for and discovered cloud data assets that met certain search criteria (i.e., intersects with our region of interest and for a specified date range). The end goal was to find and save web links to the data assets we want to use in our workflow. The links we found allow us to download data via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). However, NASA allows for direct in-region S3 bucket access for the same assets. In addition to saving the HTTPS links, we also created and saved the S3 links for those same cloud assets and we will use them here. In this exercise we will demonstrate how to perform direction in-region S3 bucket access for Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) cloud data assets.\n\nDirect S3 Access\nNASA Eartdata Cloud provides two pathways for accessing data from the cloud. The first is via HTTPS. The other is through direct S3 bucket access. Below are some benefits and considerations when choosing to use direct S3 bucket access for NASA cloud assets.\n\nBenefits\n\nRetrieve data is very quickly\nNo need to download data! Work with data in a more efficient manner\nIncreased capacity to do parallel processing\nYou are working completely with the AWS cloud ecosystem and thus have access to the might of all AWS offerings (e.g., infrastructure, S3 API, services, etc.)\n\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nAccess only works within AWS us-west-2 region\nNeed an AWS S3 “token” to access S3 Bucket\nToken expires after 1 hour\nToken only works at the DAAC that generates it, e.g.,\n\nPO.DAAC token generator: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials\nLP DAAC token generator: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials\n\nS3 on its own does not solve ‘cloud’ problems, but it is one key technology in solving big data problems\nStill have to load things in to memory, parallelize the computation, if working with really large data volumes. There are a lot of tool that allow you to do that, not discussed in this tutorial\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\nConfigure our notebook environment and retrieve temporary S3 credentials for in-region direct S3 bucket access\nAccess a single HLS file\nAccess and clip an HLS file to a region of interest\nCreate an HLS time series data array\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\n\nImport Required Packages\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport requests\nimport boto3\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rasterio as rio\nfrom rasterio.session import AWSSession\nfrom rasterio.plot import show\nimport rioxarray\nimport geopandas\nimport pyproj\nfrom pyproj import Proj\nfrom shapely.ops import transform\nimport geoviews as gv\nfrom cartopy import crs\nimport hvplot.xarray\nimport holoviews as hv\ngv.extension('bokeh', 'matplotlib')"

    "section": "Configure Local Environment and Get Temporary Credentials",
    "text": "To perform direct S3 data access one needs to acquire temporary S3 credentials. The credentials give users direct access to S3 buckets in NASA Earthdata Cloud. AWS credentials should not be shared, so take precautions when using them in notebooks our scripts. Note, these temporary credentials are valid for only 1 hour. For more information regarding the temporary credentials visit https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME. A netrc file is required to aquire these credentials. Use the NASA Earthdata Authentication to create a netrc file in your home directory.\ns3_cred_endpoint = 'https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials'\ndef get_temp_creds():\n    temp_creds_url = s3_cred_endpoint\n    return requests.get(temp_creds_url).json()\ntemp_creds_req = get_temp_creds()\n#temp_creds_req                      # !!! BEWARE, removing the # on this line will print your temporary S3 credentials.\n\nInsert the credentials into our boto3 session and configure our rasterio environment for data access\nCreate a boto3 Session object using your temporary credentials. This Session is used to pass credentials and configuration to AWS so we can interact wit S3 objects from applicable buckets.\nsession = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id=temp_creds_req['accessKeyId'], \n                        aws_secret_access_key=temp_creds_req['secretAccessKey'],\n                        aws_session_token=temp_creds_req['sessionToken'],\n                        region_name='us-west-2')\nFor this exercise, we are going to open up a context manager for the notebook using the rasterio.env module to store the required GDAL and AWS configurations we need to access the data in Earthdata Cloud. While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access Earthdata Cloud data assets. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files. GDAL has a lot of environment variables that control it’s behavior. Changing these settings can mean the difference being able to access a file or not. They can also have an impact on the performance.\n\nrio_env = rio.Env(AWSSession(session),\n                  GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN='EMPTY_DIR',\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'),\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'))\nrio_env.__enter__()\n\n<rasterio.env.Env at 0x7fe992047490>"

    "text": "First, what do we mean by a “service”?\nIn the context of NASA Earthdata, we are usually referring to a service as any data transformation or customization process that packages or delivers data in a way that makes it easier to work with compared to how the data are natively archived at NASA EOSDIS. Basic customization options may include: * Subsetting (cropping) the data by: * Variable * Spatial boundary, * Temporal range * Reformatting * For example: From NetCDF-4 to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF * Reprojection and/or Resampling * For example: From Sinusoidal to Polar Stereographic * Mosaicking * Aggregating\nA few main types or pathways for services that are commonly supported across the NASA DAACs include: * NASA Global Imagery Browse Service * Web services providing imagery, much of which is updated daily, to broaden accessibility of NASA EOSDIS data to the media and public. * Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) * Tiled Web Map Service (TWMS) * Web Map Service (WMS) * Keyhole Markup Language (KML) * Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) * OPeNDAP * The Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol is a NASA community standard DAP that provides a simple way to access and work with data over the internet. OPeNDAP’s client/server software allows us to subset and reformat data using an internet browser, command line interface, and other applications. * Harmony * In the most basic sense, Harmony is an Application Programming Interface, or API, allowing us to request customization options described above, which are then processed and returned as file outputs. Harmony helps to reduce pre-processing steps so we can spend less time preparing the data, and more time doing science.\nNote: These service offerings are unique to each NASA EOSDIS dataset.\nWhy is this?\nDue to varying levels of service, cloud migration status, and unique characteristics of the datasets themselves, not all service options are provided for all datasets. Therefore it is important to first explore a given dataset’s metadata to discover what service options are provided.\nLet’s utilize the CMR API skills we learned on Day 1 to inspect service metadata:\nurl = 'https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search'\nWe want to search by collection to inspect the access and service options that exist:\ncollection_url = f'{url}/{\"collections\"}'\nIn the CMR introduction tutorial, we explored cloud-hosted collections from different DAAC providers, and identified the CMR concept-id for a given data set id (also referred to as a short_name).\nHere we are jumping ahead and already know the concept_id we are interested in, by browsing cloud-hosted datasets from PO.DAAC in Earthdata Search: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/podaac-cloud/search.\nWe are going to focus on MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0: GHRSST Level 2P Global Sea Surface Skin Temperature from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua satellite (GDS2). Let’s first save this as a variable that we can use later on once we request data from Harmony.\nshort_name= 'MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0'\nconcept_id = 'C1940473819-POCLOUD'\nWe will view the top-level metadata for this collection to see what additional service and variable metadata exist.\nresponse = requests.get(collection_url, \n                        params={\n

In this case, we see that this dataset supports the ability to reformat, subset by space and time, as well as by variable. This is used in web applications like Earthdata Search to surface those customization options more readily.\n\nService Features\n\nIn this case, we see three separate “features” listed here: esi, Harmony, and OPeNDAP.\n\n\nWe will dig into more details on what Harmony offers for this dataset.\nFirst, we need to isolate the services returned for this dataset:\n\nservices = response['feed']['entry'][0]['associations']['services']\nprint(services)\n\n['S1962070864-POCLOUD', 'S2004184019-POCLOUD']\n\n\nservice_url = \"https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/services\"\nInspect the first service returned. Now we’re going to search the services endpoint to view that individual service’s metadata, like we did with our dataset above. This time, we’re explicitly setting the format of the response to umm-json in the Accept Header in order to see detailed metadata about the service.\nservice_response = requests.get(service_url, \n                        params={\n                            'concept_id': services[0],\n                            },\n                        headers={\n                            'Accept': 'application/vnd.nasa.cmr.umm_results+json'\n                            }\n                       )\nservice_response = service_response.json()\nDetails about the service metadata record include the service options provided by the “backend” processor connected to Harmony, in this case the PODAAC Level 2 Cloud Subsetter:\n\npprint(service_response)\n\n{'hits': 1,\n 'items': [{'meta': {'concept-id': 'S1962070864-POCLOUD',\n                     'concept-type': 'service',\n                     'deleted': False,\n                     'format': 'application/vnd.nasa.cmr.umm+json',\n                     'native-id': 'POCLOUD_podaac_l2_cloud_subsetter',\n                     'provider-id': 'POCLOUD',\n                     'revision-date': '2021-11-02T22:57:03.597Z',\n                     'revision-id': 19,\n                     'user-id': 'podaaccloud'},\n            'umm': {'AccessConstraints': 'None',\n                    'Description': 'Endpoint for subsetting L2 Subsetter via '\n                                   'Harmony',\n                    'LongName': 'PODAAC Level 2 Cloud Subsetter',\n                    'MetadataSpecification': {'Name': 'UMM-S',\n                                              'URL': 'https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/umm/service/v1.4',\n                                              'Version': '1.4'},\n                    'Name': 'PODAAC L2 Cloud Subsetter',\n                    'OperationMetadata': [{'OperationName': 'SPATIAL_SUBSETTING'},\n                                          {'OperationName': 'VARIABLE_SUBSETTING'},\n                                          {'OperationName': 'TEMPORAL_SUBSETTING'}],\n                    'ServiceKeywords': [{'ServiceCategory': 'EARTH SCIENCE '\n                                                            'SERVICES',\n                                         'ServiceTerm': 'SUBSETTING/SUPERSETTING',\n                                         'ServiceTopic': 'DATA MANAGEMENT/DATA '\n                                                         'HANDLING'}],\n                    'ServiceOptions': {'Subset': {'SpatialSubset': {'BoundingBox': {'AllowMultipleValues': False}},\n                                                  'TemporalSubset': {'AllowMultipleValues': False},\n                                                  'VariableSubset': {'AllowMultipleValues': True}},\n                                       'SupportedReformattings': [{'SupportedInputFormat': 'HDF5',\n                                                                   'SupportedOutputFormats': ['NETCDF-4']},\n                                                                  {'SupportedInputFormat': 'NETCDF-4',\n                                                                   'SupportedOutputFormats': ['NETCDF-4']}]},\n                    'ServiceOrganizations': [{'LongName': 'Physical '\n                                                          'Oceanography '\n                                                          'Distributed Active '\n                                                          'Archive Center, Jet '\n                                                          'Propulsion '\n                                                          'Laboratory, NASA',\n                                              'Roles': ['ORIGINATOR'],\n                                              'ShortName': 'NASA/JPL/PODAAC'}],\n                    'Type': 'Harmony',\n                    'URL': {'Description': 'PROJECT HOME PAGE',\n                            'URLValue': 'https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov'},\n                    'Version': '1.1.0'}}],\n 'took': 9}\n\n\n\n\nDiscover all datasets that support Harmony services\nInstead of searching for services on a known dataset of interest, we may want to discovery all available datasets that are supported for a given service. We can utilize GraphQL, which is a way for us to efficiently gain information across service and collection metadata so that we can print out all supported Harmony datasets. First, we need to specify a query string. Here we are asking to query all collections with service type “Harmony”, and to provide details on the service options attached to those services:\nquery = \"\"\"query {\n  collections(limit: 2000, serviceType: \"Harmony\") {\n    count\n    items {\n      shortName\n      conceptId\n      services {\n        count\n        items {\n          name\n          supportedReformattings\n          supportedInputProjections\n          supportedOutputProjections\n          serviceOptions\n        }\n      }\n      variables {\n        count\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\"\"\"\nThis utilizes a different API endpoint to query CMR metdata using GraphQL. Here we set up another request, passing our query string above:\ngraphql_url = 'https://graphql.earthdata.nasa.gov/api'\n\ngraphql_response = requests.get(graphql_url,\n                        params={\"query\": query},\n                        headers={\n                            'Accept': 'application/json',\n                        }\n                       )\nA json response is returned that provides all collections with Harmony-supported services. We can then extract just the collectionshortName, conceptID, and the service names supported for each collection:\n\nservices = graphql_response.json()['data']['collections']['items']\n\nfor service in services:\n    print(service['shortName'], \",\", service['conceptId'])\n    for i in range(len(service['services']['items'])):\n        print(\"Services:\", service['services']['items'][i]['name'])\n\nECCO_L4_ATM_STATE_05DEG_DAILY_V4R4 , C1990404801-POCLOUD\nServices: PO.DAAC Cloud OPeNDAP\nServices: PO.DAAC

    "text": "Harmony-Py provides a pip installable Python alternative to directly using Harmony’s RESTful API to make it easier to request data and service options, especially when interacting within a Python Jupyter Notebook environment.\nThe next steps are adopted from the introduction tutorial notebook provided in the Harmony-Py library:\n\nCreate Harmony Client object\nFirst, we need to create a Harmony Client, which is what we will interact with to submit and inspect a data request to Harmony, as well as to retrieve results.\nWhen creating the Client, we need to provide Earthdata Login credentials, which are required to access data from NASA EOSDIS. This basic line below assumes that we have a .netrc available.\nharmony_client = Client()\n\n\nHurricane Ida snapshot\nUsing NASA Worldview, we can first explore SST during a tropical storm event; in this case, we can overlay L2 and L4 SST variables against true color imagery to observe Hurricane Ida in August 2021. Although this is a small sample set, this use case could be expanded to explore how SST responds during the Atlantic hurricane over the next several months. The same data that we are requesting below using Harmony-py can also be requested using NASA Earthdata Search\n\n\n\nHurrican Ida snapshot - Worldview\n\n\n\n\nCreate Harmony Request\nThe following are common request parameters:\n\ncollection: Required parameter. This is the NASA EOSDIS collection, or data product. There are two options for inputting a collection of interest:\n\nProvide a concept ID (e.g. C1940473819-POCLOUD)\nData product short name (e.g. MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0).\n\nspatial: Bounding box spatial constraints on the data. The Harmony Bbox class accepts spatial coordinates as decimal degrees in w, s, e, n order, where longitude = -180, 180 and latitude = -90, 90.\ntemporal: Date/time constraints on the data. The example below demonstrates temporal start and end ranges using the python datetime library.\n\nAs we identified above, only subsetting options are available for this dataset. If other service options such as reformatting are available for a given dataset, these can also be specified using Harmony-py: See the documentation for details on how to construct these parameters.\nrequest = Request(\n    collection=Collection(id=short_name),\n    spatial=BBox(-97.77667,21.20806,-83.05197,30.16605),\n    temporal={\n        'start': dt.datetime(2021, 8, 20),\n        'stop': dt.datetime(2021, 8, 21),\n    },\n)\n\n\nCheck Request validity\nBefore submitting a Harmony Request, we can test your request to see if it’s valid and how to fix it if not. In particular, request.is_valid will check to ensure that the spatial BBox bounds and temporal ranges are entered correctly.\n\nrequest.is_valid()\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nSubmit request\nNow that the request is created, we can now submit it to Harmony using the Harmony Client object. A job id is returned, which is a unique identifier that represents the submitted request.\n\njob_id = harmony_client.submit(request)\njob_id\n\n'e36f6916-a7d9-4d82-a5fa-924d48d464ef'\n\n\n\n\nCheck request status\nWe can check on the progress of a processing job with status(). This method blocks while communicating with the server but returns quickly.\n\nharmony_client.status(job_id)\n\n{'status': 'running',\n 'message': 'There were 2 collections that matched the provided short name MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0.

    "section": "Step 5. Tracking changes (Optional)",
    "text": "Now that you have forked and cloned the repository in your Hub, you can make changes (edit, add, and/or delete content) and track these files using git. In this step, we will provide an overview of how to use git using the graphical interface (the JupyterLab git extension).\n\nStep 5.1. Configure Git (git config)\nConfigure git with your name and email address as shown here.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nOpen a new terminal: File >> New >> Terminal\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5.5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\n\nStep 5.2. Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File >> New >> Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push) {#step-5.5.-transmit-committed-changes-to-your-github-(git-push}\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub will prompt you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (DO NOT use your password). To create a Personal Access Token, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add > commit > push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New > Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."

    "text": "As Geoscientists, we often work with time series of data with two or more dimensions: a time series of calibrated, orthorectified satellite images; two-dimensional grids of surface air temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis; or three-dimensional (level, x, y) cubes of ocean salinity from an ocean model. These data are often provided in GeoTIFF, NetCDF or HDF format with rich and useful metadata that we want to retain, or even use in our analysis. Common analyses include calculating means, standard deviations and anomalies over time or one or more spatial dimensions (e.g. zonal means). Model output often includes multiple variables that you want to apply similar analyses to.\n\n\n\nA schematic of multi-dimensional data\n\n\nThe schematic above shows a typical data structure for multi-dimensional data. There are two data cubes, one for temperature and one for precipitation. Common coordinate variables, in this case latitude, longitude and time are associated with each variable. Each variable, including coordinate variables, will have a set of attributes: name, units, missing value, etc. The file containing the data may also have attributes: source of the data, model name coordinate reference system if the data are projected. Writing code using low-level packages such as netcdf4 and numpy to read the data, then perform analysis, and write the results to file is time consuming and prone to errors."

For example, if I want to convert the units of air from Kelvin to degrees Celsius.\nds['air'] = ds.air - 273.15\nThis approach can also be used to add new variables\nds['air_kelvin'] = ds.air + 273.15\nIt is helpful to update attributes such as units, this saves time, confusion and mistakes, especially when you save the dataset.\nds['air'].attrs['units'] = 'degC'\n\nds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:     (lat: 25, time: 2920, lon: 53)\nCoordinates:\n  * lat         (lat) float32 75.0 72.5 70.0 67.5 65.0 ... 22.5 20.0 17.5 15.0\n  * lon         (lon) float32 200.0 202.5 205.0 207.5 ... 325.0 327.5 330.0\n  * time        (time) datetime64[ns] 2013-01-01 ... 2014-12-31T18:00:00\nData variables:\n    air         (time, lat, lon) float32 -31.95 -30.65 -29.65 ... 23.04 22.54\n    air_kelvin  (time, lat, lon) float32 241.2 242.5 243.5 ... 296.5 296.2 295.7\nAttributes:\n    Conventions:  COARDS\n    title:        4x daily NMC reanalysis (1948)\n    description:  Data is from NMC initialized reanalysis\\n(4x/day).

I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado. The bounding box for the state is [-109 E, -102 E, 37 N, 41 N].\nIn the code below, pay attention to both the order of the coordinates and the range of values. The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates. Note lon is 0 to 360 not -180 to 180, and I let python calculate it for me within the slice.\n\nds.air.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.DataArray 'air' (time: 2920, lat: 2, lon: 3)>\narray([[[-10.049988 ,  -9.25     ,  -8.75     ],\n        [ -6.25     ,  -6.549988 ,  -6.3599854]],\n\n       [[-18.149994 , -14.950012 ,  -9.950012 ],\n        [-13.649994 , -11.049988 ,  -7.25     ]],\n\n       [[-20.449997 , -18.649994 , -13.359985 ],\n        [-19.350006 , -16.950012 , -11.25     ]],\n\n       ...,\n\n       [[-24.460007 , -28.259995 , -25.759995 ],\n        [-16.959991 , -24.059998 , -24.059998 ]],\n\n       [[-24.36     , -26.160004 , -23.460007 ],\n        [-15.959991 , -22.86     , -22.960007 ]],\n\n       [[-17.559998 , -15.359985 , -13.660004 ],\n        [-13.76001  , -15.959991 , -14.459991 ]]], dtype=float32)\nCoordinates:\n  * lat      (lat) float32 40.0 37.5\n  * lon      (lon) float32 252.5 255.0 257.5\n  * time     (time) datetime64[ns] 2013-01-01 ... 2014-12-31T18:00:00\nAttributes:\n    long_name:     4xDaily Air temperature at sigma level 995\n    units:         degC\n    precision:     2\n    GRIB_id:       11\n    GRIB_name:     TMP\n    var_desc:      Air temperature\n    dataset:       NMC Reanalysis\n    level_desc:    Surface\n    statistic:     Individual Obs\n    parent_stat:   Other\n    actual_range:  [185.16 322.1 ]xarray.DataArray'air'time: 2920lat: 2lon: 3-10.05 -9.25 -8.75 -6.25 -6.55 ... -15.36 -13.66 -13.76 -15.96 -14.46array([[[-10.049988 ,  -9.25     ,  -8.75     ],\n        [ -6.25     ,  -6.549988 ,  -6.3599854]],\n\n       [[-18.149994 , -14.950012 ,  -9.950012 ],\n        [-13.649994 , -11.049988 ,  -7.25     ]],\n\n       [[-20.449997 , -18.649994 , -13.359985 ],\n        [-19.350006 , -16.950012 , -11.25     ]],\n\n       ...,\n\n       [[-24.460007 , -28.259995 , -25.759995 ],\n        [-16.959991 , -24.059998 , -24.059998 ]],\n\n       [[-24.36     , -26.160004 , -23.460007 ],\n        [-15.959991 , -22.86     , -22.960007 ]],\n\n       [[-17.559998 , -15.359985 , -13.660004 ],\n        [-13.76001  , -15.959991 , -14.459991 ]]], dtype=float32)Coordinates: (3)lat(lat)float3240.0 37.5standard_name :latitudelong_name :Latitudeunits :degrees_northaxis :Yarray([40. , 37.5], dtype=float32)lon(lon)float32252.5 255.0 257.5standard_name :longitudelong_name :Longitudeunits :degrees_eastaxis :Xarray([252.5, 255. , 257.5], dtype=float32)time(time)datetime64[ns]2013-01-01 ... 2014-12-31T18:00:00standard_name :timelong_name :Timearray(['2013-01-01T00:00:00.000000000', '2013-01-01T06:00:00.000000000',\n       '2013-01-01T12:00:00.000000000', ..., '2014-12-31T06:00:00.000000000',\n       '2014-12-31T12:00:00.000000000', '2014-12-31T18:00:00.000000000'],\n      dtype='datetime64[ns]')Attributes: (11)long_name :4xDaily Air temperature at sigma level 995units :degCprecision :2GRIB_id :11GRIB_name :TMPvar_desc :Air temperaturedataset :NMC Reanalysislevel_desc :Surfacestatistic :Individual Obsparent_stat :Otheractual_range :[185.16 322.1 ]\n\n\nWhat if we want temperature for a point, for example Denver, CO (39.72510678889283 N, -104.98785545855408 E). xarray can handle this!

    "text": "This tutorial will combine several workflow steps and components from the previous days, demonstrating the process of using the geolocation of data available outside of the Earthdata Cloud to then access coincident variables of cloud-accessible data. This may be a common use case as NASA Earthdata continues to migrate to the cloud, producing a “hybrid” data archive across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and original on-premise data storage systems. Additionally, you may also want to combine field measurements with remote sensing data available on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThis specific example explores the pairing of the ICESat-2 ATL07 Sea Ice Height data product, currently (as of November 2021) available publicly via direct download at the NSIDC DAAC, along with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the GHRSST MODIS L2 dataset (MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0) available from PO.DAAC on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThe use case we’re looking at today centers over an area north of Greenland for a single day in June, where a melt pond was observed using the NASA OpenAltimetry application. Melt ponds are an important feature of Arctic sea ice dynamics, leading to an decrease in sea ice albedo and other changes in heat balance. Many NASA Earthdata datasets produce variables including sea ice albedo, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and sea ice height, which can be used to better understand these dynamics.\n\nObjectives\n\nPractice skills searching for data in CMR, determining granule coverage across two datasets over an area of interest.\nDownload data from an on-premise storage system to our cloud environment.\nRead in 1-dimensional trajectory data (ICESat-2 ATL07) into xarray and perform attribute conversions.\nSelect and read in sea surface temperature (SST) data (MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0) from the Earthdata Cloud into xarray.\nExtract, resample, and plot coincident SST data based on ICESat-2 geolocation."

We are working together to develop a shared library of resources - including existing resources, new code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - that simplify the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and manipulating ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific discovery.” - NSIDC DAAC Data Access and Service API - The API provided by the NSIDC DAAC allows you to access data programmatically using specific temporal and spatial filters. The same subsetting, reformatting, and reprojection services available on select data sets through NASA Earthdata Search can also be applied using this API. - IceFlow - The IceFlow python library simplifies accessing and combining data from several of NASA’s cryospheric altimetry missions, including ICESat/GLAS, Operation IceBridge, and ICESat-2. In particular, IceFlow harmonizes the various file formats and georeferencing parameters across several of the missions’ data sets, allowing you to analyze data across the multi-decadal time series.\nWe’ve found 2 granules. We’ll download the first one and write it to a file with the same name as the producer_granule_id.\nWe need the url for the granule as well. This is href links we printed out above.\nicesat_id = granules[0]['producer_granule_id']\nicesat_url = granules[0]['links'][0]['href']\nTo retrieve the granule data, we use the requests.get() method, which will utilize the .netrc file on the backend to authenticate the request against Earthdata Login.\nr = requests.get(icesat_url)\nThe response returned by requests has the same structure as all the other responses: a header and contents. The header information has information about the response, including the size of the data we downloaded in bytes.\n\nfor k, v in r.headers.items():\n    print(f'{k}: {v}')\n\nDate: Thu, 18 Nov 2021 04:02:03 GMT\nServer: Apache\nVary: User-Agent\nContent-Disposition: attachment\nContent-Length: 248607461\nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nThe contents needs to be saved to a file. To keep the directory clean, we will create a downloads directory to store the file. We can use a shell command to do this or use the makedirs method from the os package.\nos.makedirs(\"downloads\", exist_ok=True)\nYou should see a downloads directory in the file browser.\nTo write the data to a file, we use open to open a file. We need to specify that the file is open for writing by using the write-mode w. We also need to specify that we want to write bytes by setting the binary-mode b. This is important because the response contents are bytes. The default mode for open is text-mode. So make sure you use b.\nWe’ll use the with statement context-manager to open the file, write the contents of the response, and then close the file. Once the data in r.content is written sucessfully to the file, or if there is an error, the file is closed by the context-manager.\nWe also need to prepend the downloads path to the filename. We do this using Path from the pathlib package in the standard library.\noutfile = Path('downloads', icesat_id)\nif not outfile.exists():\n    with open(outfile, 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(r.content)\nATL07-01_20190622055317_12980301_004_01.h5 is an HDF5 file. xarray can open this but you need to tell it which group to read the data from. In this case we read the sea ice segment height data for ground-track 1 left-beam. You can explore the variable hierarchy in Earthdata Search, by selecting the Customize option under Download Data.\nThis code block performs the following operations: - Extracts the height_segment_height variable from the heights group, along with the dimension variables contained in the higher level sea_ice_segments group, - Convert attributes from bytestrings to strings, - Drops the HDF attribute DIMENSION_LIST, - Sets _FillValue to NaN\n\nvariable_names = [\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/latitude',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/longitude',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/delta_time',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/heights/height_segment_height'\n    ]\nwith h5py.File(outfile, 'r') as h5:\n    data_vars = {}\n    for varname in variable_names:\n        var = h5[varname]\n        name = varname.split('/')[-1]\n        #

    "text": "Our CMR granule search returned 14 files for our time and area of interest. However, not all granules will be suitable for analysis.\nI’ve identified the image with granule id G1956158784-POCLOUD as a good candidate, this is the 9th granule. In this image, our area of interest is close to nadir. This means that the instantaneous field of view over the area of interest cover a smaller area than at the edge of the image.\nWe are looking for the link for direct download access via s3. This is a url but with a prefix s3://. This happens to be the first href link in the metadata.\nFor a single granule we can cut and paste the s3 link. If we have several granules, the s3 links can be extracted with some simple code.\n\ngranule = granules[9]\n\nfor link in granule['links']:\n    if link['href'].startswith('s3://'):\n        s3_link = link['href']\n        \ns3_link\n\n's3://podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0/20190622100001-JPL-L2P_GHRSST-SSTskin-MODIS_A-D-v02.0-fv01.0.nc'\n\n\n\nGet S3 credentials\nAs with the previous S3 download tutorials we need credentials to access data from s3: access keys and tokens.\ns3_credentials = requests.get('https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials').json()\nEssentially, what we are doing in this step is to “mount” the s3 bucket as a file system. This allows us to treat the S3 bucket in a similar way to a local file system.\ns3_fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(\n    key=s3_credentials[\"accessKeyId\"],\n    secret=s3_credentials[\"secretAccessKey\"],\n    token=s3_credentials[\"sessionToken\"],\n)\n\n\nOpen a s3 file\nNow we have the S3FileSystem set up, we can access the granule. xarray cannot open a S3File directly, so we use the open method for the S3FileSystem to open the granule using the endpoint url we extracted from the metadata. We also have to set the mode='rb'. This opens the granule in read-only mode and in byte-mode. Byte-mode is important. By default, open opens a file as text - in this case it would just be a string of characters - and xarray doesn’t know what to do with that.\nWe then pass the S3File object f to xarray.open_dataset. For this dataset, we also have to set decode_cf=False. This switch tells xarray not to use information contained in variable attributes to generate human readable coordinate variables. Normally, this should work for netcdf files but for this particular cloud-hosted dataset, variable attribute data is not in the form expected by xarray. We’ll fix this.\nf = s3_fs.open(s3_link, mode='rb')\nmodis_ds = xr.open_dataset(f, decode_cf=False)\nIf you click on the Show/Hide Attributes icon (the first document-like icon to the right of coordinate variable metadata) you can see that attributes are one-element arrays containing bytestrings.\n\nmodis_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (nj: 2030, ni: 1354, time: 1)\nCoordinates:\n  * time                     (time) int32 1214042401\nDimensions without coordinates: nj, ni\nData variables:\n    lat                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    lon                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sea_surface_temperature  (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    sst_dtime                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    quality_level            (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    sses_bias                (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    sses_standard_deviation  (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    l2p_flags                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    chlorophyll_a            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    K_490                    (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    wind_speed               (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    dt_analysis              (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\nAttributes: (12/49)\n    Conventions:                [b'CF-1.7, ACDD-1.3']\n    title:                      [b'MODIS Aqua L2P SST']\n    summary:                    [b'Sea surface temperature retrievals produce...\n    references:                 [b'GHRSST Data Processing Specification v2r5']\n    institution:                [b'NASA/JPL/OBPG/RSMAS']\n    history:                    [b'MODIS L2P created at JPL PO.DAAC']\n    ...                         ...\n    publisher_email:            [b'ghrsst-po@nceo.ac.uk']\n    processing_level:           [b'L2P']\n    cdm_data_type:              [b'swath']\n    startDirection:             [b'Ascending']\n    endDirection:               [b'Descending']\n    day_night_flag:             [b'Day']xarray.DatasetDimensions:nj: 2030ni: 1354time: 1Coordinates: (1)time(time)int321214042401long_name :[b'reference time of sst file']standard_name :[b'time']units :[b'seconds since 1981-01-01 00:00:00']comment :[b'time of first sensor observation']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate']array([1214042401], dtype=int32)Data variables: (12)lat(nj, ni)float32...long_name :[b'latitude']standard_name :[b'latitude']units :[b'degrees_north']_FillValue :[-999.]valid_min :[-90.]valid_max :[90.]comment :[b'geographical coordinates, WGS84 projection']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate'][2748620 values with dtype=float32]lon(nj, ni)float32...long_name :[b'longitude']standard_name :[b'longitude']units :[b'degrees_east']_FillValue :[-999.]valid_min :[-180.]valid_max :[180.]comment :[b'geographical coordinates, WGS84 projection']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate'][2748620 values with dtype=float32]sea_surface_temperature(time, nj, ni)int16...long_name :[b'sea surface temperature']standard_name :[b'sea_surface_skin_temperature']units :[b'kelvin']_FillValue :[-32767]valid_min :[-1000]valid_max :[10000]comment :[b'sea surface temperature from thermal IR (11 um) channels']scale_factor :[0.005]add_offset :[273.15]source :[b'NASA and University of Miami']coordinates :[b'lon lat']coverage_content_type :[b'physicalMeasurement'][2748620 values with dtype=int16]sst_dtime(time, nj, ni)int16...long_name :[b'time difference from reference time']units :[b'seconds']_FillValue :[-32768]valid_min :[-32767]valid_max :[32767]comment :[b'time plus sst_dtime gives seconds after 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1981']coordinates :[b'lon lat']coverage_content_type :[b'referenceInformation'][2748620 values with dtype=int16]quality_level(time, nj, ni)int8...long_name :[b'quality level of SST pixel']_FillValue :[-128]valid_min :[0]valid_max :[5]comment :[b'thermal IR SST proximity confidence value; signed byte array: WARNING Some applications are unable to properly handle signed byte values.

We use the decode method to do this. The bytestrings are encoded as utf-8, which is a unicode character format. This is the default encoding for decode but we’ve included it as an argument to be explicit.\nNot all attributes are bytestrings. Some are floats. Take a look at _FillValue, and valid_min and valid_max. To avoid an error, we use the isinstance function to check if the value of an attributes is type bytes - a bytestring. If it is, then we decode it. If not, we just extract the scalar and do nothing else.\nWe also fix the global attributes.\ndef fix_attributes(da):\n    '''Decodes bytestring attributes to strings'''\n    for attr, value in da.attrs.items():\n        if isinstance(value[0], bytes):\n            da.attrs[attr] = value[0].decode('utf-8')\n        else:\n            da.attrs[attr] = value[0]\n    return\n\n# Fix variable attributes\nfor var in modis_ds.variables:\n    da = modis_ds[var]\n    fix_attributes(da)\n            \n# Fix global attributes\nfix_attributes(modis_ds)\nWith this done, we can use the xarray function decode_cf to convert the attributes.\nmodis_ds = xr.decode_cf(modis_ds)\n\nmodis_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (nj: 2030, ni: 1354, time: 1)\nCoordinates:\n    lat                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    lon                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n  * time                     (time) datetime64[ns] 2019-06-22T10:00:01\nDimensions without coordinates: nj, ni\nData variables:\n    sea_surface_temperature  (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sst_dtime                (time, nj, ni) timedelta64[ns] ...\n    quality_level            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sses_bias                (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sses_standard_deviation  (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    l2p_flags                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    chlorophyll_a            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    K_490                    (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    wind_speed               (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    dt_analysis              (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\nAttributes: (12/49)\n    Conventions:                CF-1.7, ACDD-1.3\n    title:                      MODIS Aqua L2P SST\n    summary:                    Sea surface temperature retrievals produced a...\n    references:                 GHRSST Data Processing Specification v2r5\n    institution:                NASA/JPL/OBPG/RSMAS\n    history:                    MODIS L2P created at JPL PO.DAAC\n    ...                         ...\n    publisher_email:            ghrsst-po@nceo.ac.uk\n    processing_level:           L2P\n    cdm_data_type:              swath\n    startDirection:             Ascending\n    endDirection:               Descending\n    day_night_flag:             Dayxarray.DatasetDimensions:nj: 2030ni: 1354time: 1Coordinates: (3)lat(nj, ni)float32...long_name :latitudestandard_name :latitudeunits :degrees_northvalid_min :-90.0valid_max :90.0comment :geographical coordinates, WGS84 projectioncoverage_content_type :coordinate[2748620 values with dtype=float32]lon(nj, ni)float32...long_name :longitudestandard_name :longitudeunits :degrees_eastvalid_min :-180.0valid_max :180.0comment :geographical coordinates, WGS84 projectioncoverage_content_type :coordinate[2748620 values with dtype=float32]time(time)datetime64[ns]2019-06-22T10:00:01long_name :reference time of sst filestandard_name :timecomment :time of first sensor observationcoverage_content_type :coordinatearray(['2019-06-22T10:00:01.000000000'], dtype='datetime64[ns]')Data variables: (10)sea_surface_temperature(time, nj, ni)float32...long_name :sea surface temperaturestandard_name :sea_surface_skin_temperatureunits :kelvinvalid_min :-1000valid_max :10000comment :sea surface temperature from thermal IR (11 um) channelssource :NASA and University of Miamicoverage_content_type :physicalMeasurement[2748620 values with dtype=float32]sst_dtime(time, nj, ni)timedelta64[ns]...long_name :time difference from reference timevalid_min :-32767valid_max :32767comment :time plus sst_dtime gives seconds after 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1981coverage_content_type :referenceInformation[2748620 values with dtype=timedelta64[ns]]quality_level(time, nj, ni)float32...long_name :quality level of SST pixelvalid_min :0valid_max :5comment :thermal IR SST proximity confidence value; signed byte array: WARNING Some applications are unable to properly handle signed byte values.

ICESat-2 sea surface heights are irregularly spaced segments along one ground-track traced by the ATLAS instrument on-board ICESat-2. Fortunately, pyresample allows us to resample swath data.\npyresample has many resampling methods. We’re going to use the nearest neighbour resampling method, which is implemented using a k-dimensional tree algorithm or K-d tree. K-d trees are data structures that improve search efficiency for large data sets.\nThe first step is to define the geometry of the ICESat-2 and MODIS data. To do this we use the latitudes and longitudes of the datasets.\nis2_geometry = pyresample.SwathDefinition(lons=is2_ds.longitude,\n                                          lats=is2_ds.latitude)\nmodis_geometry = pyresample.SwathDefinition(lons=modis_ds.lon, lats=modis_ds.lat)\nWe then implement the resampling method, passing the two geometries we have defined, the data array we want to resample - in this case sea surface temperature, and a search radius. The resampling method expects a numpy.Array rather than an xarray.DataArray, so we use values to get the data as a numpy.Array.\nWe set the search radius to 1000 m. The MODIS data is nominally 1km spacing.\nsearch_radius=1000.\nfill_value = np.nan\nis2_sst = pyresample.kd_tree.resample_nearest(\n    modis_geometry,\n    modis_ds.sea_surface_temperature.values,\n    is2_geometry,\n    search_radius,\n    fill_value=fill_value\n)\n\nis2_sst\n\narray([263.375, 263.375, 263.375, ...,     nan,     nan,     nan],\n      dtype=float32)\n\n\n\nis2_ds['sea_surface_temperature'] = xr.DataArray(is2_sst, dims='segment')\nis2_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (segment: 235584)\nDimensions without coordinates: segment\nData variables:\n    latitude                 (segment) float64 82.38 82.38 82.38 ... 72.61 72.61\n    longitude                (segment) float64 -55.11 -55.11 ... 145.1 145.1\n    delta_time               (segment) float64 4.642e+07 4.642e+07 ... 4.642e+07\n    height_segment_height    (segment) float32 nan nan nan ... -0.4335 -0.4463\n    sea_surface_temperature  (segment) float32 263.4 263.4 263.4 ... nan nan nanxarray.DatasetDimensions:segment: 235584Coordinates: (0)Data variables: (5)latitude(segment)float6482.38 82.38 82.38 ... 72.61 72.61contentType :referenceInformationcoordinates :delta_time longitudedescription :Latitude, WGS84, North=+, Lat of segment centerlong_name :Latitudesource :ATBD, section 4.4standard_name :latitudeunits :degrees_northvalid_max :90.0valid_min :-90.0array([82.38431982, 82.38431982, 82.38431982, ..., 72.60984638,\n       72.60977493, 72.60970985])longitude(segment)float64-55.11 -55.11 ... 145.1 145.1contentType :referenceInformationcoordinates :delta_time latitudedescription :Longitude, WGS84, East=+,Lon of segment centerlong_name :Longitudesource :ATBD, section 4.4standard_name :longitudeunits :degrees_eastvalid_max :180.0valid_min :-180.0array([-55.10896068, -55.10896068, -55.10896068, ..., 145.05396164,\n       145.05392851, 145.05389832])delta_time(segment)float644.642e+07 4.642e+07 ... 4.642e+07CLASS :DIMENSION_SCALENAME :gt1l/sea_ice_segments/delta_timeREFERENCE_LIST :[(<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)]contentType :physicalMeasurementcoordinates :latitude longitudedescription :Number of GPS seconds since the ATLAS SDP epoch.
